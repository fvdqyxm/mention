Speaker 1 ( 00:00:10 ):

Wow. So before I start my remarks tonight, I have to say one thing. Kamala Harris's campaign surrogate, Joe Biden, he called all of us garbage. Can you believe that? I'll tell you what, I don't see any garbage here. What I see is great American patriots ready to take this country back.

( 00:00:40 ):

So it's an honor to be speaking with you here today to welcome our 45th president and soon to be the 47th President of the United States to Green Bay. And as I travel around all 11 counties here in this great district, I continue to ask, "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?" And the answer is always a resounding no. We need President Trump's leadership now more than ever. Under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, we've seen record high inflation, millions of illegals crossing our border, and chaos around the world. President Trump, he solved these issues before, and he will solve them again.

( 00:01:53 ):

So like President Trump, I know what it takes to successfully run a business. We need people with real world and business experience to go to Washington who can actually go to work and solve problems for the people right here in Northeast Wisconsin. So our team's out working every single day to make sure that we not only keep District 8 in Republican hands, but also that we flip Wisconsin red and get Eric Hovde into Senate and President Trump back in this White House. So in six short days from now, we are going to fire Kamala Harris, and once again bring real leadership to Washington. But we can't do it without you. We need you to talk to your friends, talk to your family, and get everybody you know to either vote on or before November 5th. So if you're ready to put a stop to this out of control government spending, if you're ready to secure our border, if you're ready to bring peace around this world, then we need you to get up and get Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States of America. Thank you. God bless you. Thank you.

Speaker 2 ( 00:04:03 ):

Please welcome to the stage the next United States Senator for Wisconsin, Eric Hovde.

Eric Hovde ( 00:04:39 ):

Thank you everyone. We are all here for one reason, and that is we love our country. We've been blessed with the greatest country in the history of mankind, that beautiful constitution that has given us more civil liberties, freedoms, and prosperity than any people have ever known. But folks, the last four years has been brutal on our country America, and we have to make a change. It is definitely time for change. You could not have a more consequential election. Look at how different the two parties are. What does President Trump and I want to do? Make America great again and restore the American dream.

( 00:06:12 ):

What does Kamala Harris and Senator Baldwin want to do? They told us four years ago, "We want to change America." And man, they sure did, and it's not for the better. What do President Trump and I want to do? We want to promote and foster our free market capitalist system that have made us the wealthiest country in the history of mankind. What has Senator Baldwin and Kamala Harris want to do? They want to drag us down that path of socialism where only the people at the top benefit. What do President Trump and I want to do? We want to preserve our beautiful Constitution, and our First and Second Amendment and all the amendments.

( 00:07:17 ):

What does Kamala Harris and Senator Baldwin want to do? They want to rip up our Constitution, let liberal judges write laws. We saw how they operated with our First Amendment during COVID. Shut us down. Don't let us express our views. And every time they get a chance to vote, they want to take our guns away from us. What do President Trump and I want to do? We want to protect and strengthen the traditional family, which is the bedrock of human society. What does Kamala Harris and Senator Baldwin want to do? They want to redefine the American family. And by the way, they can't even decide what a woman is and what a guy is.

( 00:08:23 ):

Lastly, what is President Trump and me? Successful business people, where results matter and you get things done? What is Kamala Harris and Senator Baldwin? Career politicians that never get anything done except a path of destruction. So folks, it's really simple. We've got six days to decide which way our country's going to go. President Trump and me are the tip of the spears. But you know what, we have all of you, and we need all of you. Harris and Baldwin, they've got big tech, big media, big corporate interests, but we have the issues and we have you. And with you on our side, not only going out and voting, but talking to your friends, talking to your neighbors, talking to the people you go to church with. Your colleagues, the people you go hunting or fishing or whatever activities you do with you, we can take this country back. So the question is, are you ready to go restore the American dream and make America great again? Let's go.

Speaker 2 ( 00:10:20 ):

Please welcome to the stage, United States Senator, Ron Johnson.

Senator Ron Johnson ( 00:10:30 ):

Thank you, thank you fellow patriots. Thank you for coming here to show your support for the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Others have mentioned Joe Biden's, I guess, political gaffe. I guess you call that when you actually tell the truth, what he actually thinks of you. And he called you garbage, but let's face it, that's not the first time the Democrat leaders have told half of America what they thought about them. Prior to calling us garbage, he said we were all potential domestic terrorists. Kamala Harris, she's been out there basically saying that we love Nazis, we love fascists. Prior to that, Hillary Clinton as a candidate called us deplorable. And of course it was President Obama who basically said that we get bitter and we cling to our guns and religion, like that's a bad thing? I remember his wife talking about how she was never proud of America until her husband got elected president.

( 00:12:16 ):

I remember the pastor whose pew they sat in, who said, "No, no, no, no, not God Bless America. God fill-in-the-blank America. So this is a pattern of their leaders not liking this country. But let me tell you, I think that the most insulting thing that President Obama ever said was five days before he became president, he said, "In five days we're going to fundamentally transform America." Now, do you even like much less love something you want to fundamentally transform? The analogy I use, okay, I wake up in the morning, I look at my wife, Jane. "Jane, I love you. Now I'm going to change everything about you, you need a little fundamental transformation." That wouldn't go over very well, and it shouldn't go over very well to the American public when their leaders denigrate half of America. Opposing that, or contrary to that, is what we see here in this arena today, what we saw in Madison Square Garden, that the Democrats suppressed compared to a Nazi rally.

( 00:13:33 ):

What we see in this arena, what we experience and feel in this arena is a bunch of patriots who love this country, who fervently love this country, gathering to support a man, a former president, who they also know loves this country and has risked his life. You know Donald Trump didn't need to do this. He had a great life. He didn't have to risk his life, but he knew. He knew that he had to do this in order to save this country from the Democrats. Now, he's assembled an amazing coalition, really smart people. But again, whether it's Elon Musk, Robert Kennedy, Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, and now a new member of the coalition you're going to even see in just a couple of minutes, Brett Favre. This is a realignment of our politics. Republicans now are the people. We are the party that represents the working men of America. I was at an event last night with Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard, and Tulsi asked the group, " How many of you are or were former Democrats?" About half the audience, it was about 1,000 people, about half the audience raised their hand as a former Democrat or current Democrat.

( 00:15:13 ):

That is what gives me hope. The fact that President Trump and Bobby Kennedy have put their differences aside, have folks sign an area of agreement, in this case, addressing chronic illness. That not only gives me hope, they'll not only address chronic illness, but it shows the path that demonstrates exactly how you heal and unify a very divided nation. God bless those two men. So here's my final appeal to anybody listening to me, Republican, Independent, Democrat. If you love this nation, as I believe most of you do, join this new coalition of patriots who realize we have a lot of problems that we have to fix in this nation, and realize that the best way to do it is by being united, loving this nation and fixing it, making America great again. God bless all of you. God bless your efforts. God bless America.

Speaker 2 ( 00:16:24 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back former Green Bay Packer, Brett Favre.

Brett Favre ( 00:17:03 ):

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. I can tell you one thing. I knew I would come back to Green Bay at various times, but I never thought I would come back in this setting. But I think there's never been a more important time in our lives than right now in this election. First and foremost, are there any Packer fans in the house?

( 00:18:55 ):

I had a chance to visit with AJ Dillon prior to coming out here, and would've loved to have played with him. But there's nothing like Packer fans, and this is bigger than the Packers right now, but this is a special place. So thank you for the unbelievable welcome that you gave me. I love you. My wife and my grandson. I have three grandsons, the oldest, Parker, and he's going to kill me for saying it, is here tonight. And I bring up Parker because our young kids, grandkids, our own kids, nephews, nieces, are the ones that are going to be affected directly. So I wanted Parker to be here and hear this, because it's very important. But it's an honor to be back here where it all started, the campaign with the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Much like the Packer organization, Donald Trump and his organization is a winner, and the United States of America won with his leadership.

( 00:20:47 ):

But I want to address the comment that Joe Biden made yesterday or last night, that said the supporters of Donald Trump, us, are garbage. Are garbage, I can assure you, we're not garbage. How dare he say that? Looking out, I see police officers, teachers, nurses, grandparents, students. I see everyday Americans that make this country great. And as I said earlier, I have not done an event like this before, but I decided it's time. Why? Do I even have to explain why? Because the stakes are incredibly high, and families across Wisconsin are struggling to make ends meet. People's salaries haven't kept up with inflation. It's getting harder for younger people to buy their first home. People are losing hope in the American dream. And it's not just about money, people are losing their lives. Last year, 50 people here in Brown County died of a fentanyl overdose. That's 50 too many.

( 00:22:28 ):

And our kids face the prospect of World War III, really. We've already had President Trump once. We've already seen Kamala in action. We can compare, and we know which is better. The definition of insanity, I think we all know it. It's doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Sounds like the first couple of years of my tenure here with the Packers, Mike Holmgren would say, "What in the hell are you doing, Brett?" And I said, "Well, hell, I don't know, Mike." But we figured out a way to get it done. But getting back to the point at hand, it would be insane to give Kamala four more years in office. So it's time to bench Kamala and put in the star quarterback, Donald Trump. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

( 00:24:19 ):

I agree with you, USA. It's a great country. But we all know this, Kamala broke it, Trump will fix it. And as I said to you earlier about our youth, I have lived the American dream, but I want to make sure the future generations get to as well. And that would be my grandson, Parker, and his two brothers. So remember this, let's make America great again. Thank you.
