President Donald J. Trump ( 00:00 ):

So we're at the Kennedy Center. It needs a lot of work. We're going to fix it, make it beautiful. It's a very big part of the fabric of D.C. and the Capitol. We're bringing back the Capitol, we're bringing back our country. But while we're here, I thought it would be appropriate, we are tomorrow announcing and giving all of the Kennedy files.

( 00:24 ) So people have been waiting for decades for this. And I've instructed my people that are responsible, lots of different people put together by Tulsi Gabbard, and that's going to be released tomorrow. We have a tremendous amount of paper. You've got a lot of reading. I don't believe we're going to redact anything. I said, "Just don't redact. You can't redact." But we're going to be releasing the JFK files, and that would be tomorrow.

( 01:01 ) Do you have anything else to add to that, Carolyn?

Carolyn ( 01:03 ):

No, sir.

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:04 ):

So that's a big announcement. They've been waiting for that for decades. Then I said during the campaign, I'd do it, and I'm a man of my word. So tomorrow you have the JFK files. What time will they be released?

Carolyn ( 01:18 ):

Tomorrow afternoon, sir.

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:31 ):

Tomorrow afternoon. Okay.

Speaker 3 ( 01:31 ):

Have you seen what's in the files? Have you read them?

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:31 ):

I've heard about them.

Speaker 3 ( 01:31 ):

Anything interesting?

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:31 ):

It's going to be very interesting.

Speaker 4 ( 01:31 ):

Was there an executive summary supplied to you , Mr. President?

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:31 ):

No, I'm not doing summaries. You'll write your own summaries. It's many pages. Is it 80,000 pages? Approximately 80,000 pages, so it's a lot of stuff.

Speaker 5 ( 01:40 ):

Mr. President.

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:41 ):

And you'll make your own determination.

Speaker 5 ( 01:44 ):

You have criticized President Biden for using Autopen in the last few days. Have you yourself ever used Autopen, sir?

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:51 ):

Yeah, only for very unimportant papers. And I don't call them unimportant if you do letters where people write in and they'd love to have a response or we'll write responses. And I'll sign them whenever I can, but when I can't, I would use an Autopen. But to use them for what they've used them for is terrible.

Speaker 5 ( 02:13 ):

Yes, sir. And when you signed the CR.

President Donald J. Trump ( 02:13 ):

Who are you with?

Speaker 5 ( 02:13 ):

Sir, I'm with NBC.

President Donald J. Trump ( 02:15 ):

Oh, that's the same one. I don't want to talk to NBC anymore. I think you're so discredited.

Speaker 6 ( 02:21 ):

Mr. President, when most people think of the Kennedy Center, they think of the Kennedy Center Honors. It takes place in December every year. Is that something that you anticipate hosting at the White House?

President Donald J. Trump ( 02:31 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 6 ( 02:32 ):

And what do you think about that?

President Donald J. Trump ( 02:32 ):

We're going to have Honors. I think it's going to be a much bigger show than it has been in the past. It got tired, very tired, very tired, very boring, very radical left. Unless you were a radical left, it just seemed that nobody was chosen. There are a lot of people out there that can get the Honors, and we're going to do it. I think we'll have a very big show. It's going to be a very big show. We have some surprises on that show, some big surprises. But I think it has a chance to be a very big show. That's a big part of the Kennedy Center, the Honors, that evening. And so, I think you're going to be really surprised. I think it's going to get great ratings, actually.

Speaker 7 ( 03:06 ):

Mr. President, there's been some discussion about potentially meeting with Putin and your administration. If there is a peace deal signed, would you consider, would you be open to inviting Putin to the White House?

President Donald J. Trump ( 03:18 ):

Well, I don't want to really even discuss it. I've got to get the deal, and I've got to get the deal signed. 2,000 people a week sometimes are killed, and we have to get that agreement signed. But that's the only thing I think about.

Speaker 7 ( 03:32 ):

Are you confident that that could happen tomorrow, as soon as tomorrow?

President Donald J. Trump ( 03:36 ):

We're going to have a very important call. You know, we've had calls, but we're getting down to a very critical stage. And we want to get the whole Russia-Ukraine thing done. And I think Ukraine wants it. I know they want it. Everybody wants it. It's tremendous death. The bloodshed is unbelievable, like few people have ever seen before.

Speaker 7 ( 04:06 ):

And on the drug cartels, do you have a red line for the drug cartels that if crossed it would automatically trigger a military response from the US?

President Donald J. Trump ( 04:06 ):

Well, we'll see, but we're not going to put up with it. This country is not going to allow people to come in and dump drugs and kill our youth. And other than our youth too, older people are very much affected. So we're not going to let that happen. Thank you very much.

Speaker 8 ( 04:21 ):

Mr. President, on the 30-day ceasefire, Mr. President, you had already committed to-
