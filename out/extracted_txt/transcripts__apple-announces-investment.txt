President Trump ( 00:00 ):

Hello, everyone.

Speaker 1 ( 00:00 ):

Hello, Mr. President.

Speaker 2 ( 00:00 ):

Good afternoon, Mr. President.

President Trump ( 03:58 ):

Thank you very much. You know this gentleman, one of the truly great legends of our time, my book. Before we begin, I'd like to say a few words about the shooting at Fort Stewart in Georgia. As you know, five people were seriously wounded and two very, very seriously hurt around 11:00 this morning. The shooter is now in custody. And the Army Criminal Investigation Division is on site to ensure the perpetrator of this atrocity, which is exactly what it is, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Th entire nation is praying for the victims and their families, and hopefully they'll fully recover and we can put this chapter behind. But we're not going to forget what happened. We're going to take very good care of this person that did this. Horrible person.

( 04:56 ) This afternoon, we're pleased to welcome to the White House, one of the great and most esteemed business leaders and geniuses and innovators anywhere in the world. Apple CEO, Tim Cook, amazing job. Thanks as well to Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, for being here, wherever you may be.

Speaker 3 ( 05:19 ):

They're behind you.

President Trump ( 05:19 ):

Oh, there you are. Hello, fellas. I missed you.

( 05:22 ) Today, Apple is announcing that it will invest $600 billion, that's with a B, in the United States over the next four years. That's a $100 billion more than they were originally going to invest, and this is the largest investment Apple has ever made in America and anywhere else. And it's just an honor to have you. As you know, Apple's been an investor in other countries a little bit. I won't say which ones, but a couple. And they're coming home. $600 billion. It's the biggest there is.

( 05:58 ) The company's also unveiling its ambitious new American manufacturing program, which will bring factories and assembly lines across our country, all roaring-to-life areas that we're not doing so well or doing very well. We have about $17 trillion coming into the United States, which is more than ever before. That's never even come close. There's never been anything like it, even you. That's even a lot of money for you. But we have commitments of more than $17 trillion. That was as of a couple of weeks ago. These investments will directly create more than 20,000 brand-new American jobs and many thousands more at the Apple suppliers, like Corning, Broadcom, Texas Instruments, and Samsung all deal in that world. As part of this historic commitment, Apple will massively increase spending on its domestic supply chain for the iPhone and will build the largest and most sophisticated smart glass production line in the world in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, which is a great … Actually, I did very well there. I like it because I see I did very well there. I did very well in Kentucky, but it's a great place. You're going to be very happy.

( 07:11 ) I thought maybe while we're up, I'll interrupt my own speech by, you might show them a little bit about the product that you're going to be doing in Kentucky, Tim?

Tim Cook ( 07:20 ):

Absolutely. Do you mind if I step up her?

President Trump ( 07:21 ):

Yes, please.

Tim Cook ( 07:23 ):

This box was made in the US, California. And this glass comes off of a Corning line. It's engraved for President Trump. It's a unique unit of one. It was designed by a US Marine Corps corporal, a former one that works at Apple now.

President Trump ( 07:45 ):

He's done well.

Tim Cook ( 07:46 ):

He's designed it for you. And the base comes from Utah and is 24 karat gold. And it sits, I'll take the liberty of setting it up.

President Trump ( 08:01 ):

Wow.

Tim Cook ( 08:07 ):

Well, let's see. There we go. Congratulations, Mr. President.

President Trump ( 08:07 ):

Thank you very much.

Tim Cook ( 08:07 ):

Thank you so much.

President Trump ( 08:19 ):

That's fantastic. The great people of Kentucky. You're going to find it a great place to do business too. It's fantastic. Isn't that nice? We're doing these things now in the United States instead of other countries, faraway countries. This is a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America. With the mass infusion of capital it's announcing today, Apple will also build a 250,000 square foot server manufacturing facility in Houston and invest billions of dollars to construct data centers across the country from North Carolina to Iowa to Oregon. That's big stuff.

( 08:58 ) Apple will also open state-of-the-art manufacturer economy, it's going to be a manufacturing academy in Detroit, and that's a great place to do. Big things are happening in Michigan and Detroit. They're coming in because of what we've done with the … I call it the Great Big Beautiful Bill. I added one word, great. But we have probably the biggest, most comprehensive piece of legislation ever passed. It's going to mean unbelievable numbers of jobs and no jobs on … Think of this, whether it's tips or overtime or Social Security, no tax. So no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime. And it's just a small bit of it.

( 09:48 ) For Apple and other businesses, we're talking about the deductions and all of the things. And actually for people, they go out and buy a car, first time it's ever been done. We talk about deductions for companies, but they're going to be able to deduct interest when they borrow money to buy a car if it's made in America. It has to be made in America. So it is amazing. And one of the reasons I think I can say that Apple's coming here is the legislation we just passed with this kind of investment.

( 10:17 ) Apple will also open other facilities, rare earth magnets from Texas and build … Oh, I love that you're doing this. I love that. I love that. And build a brand-new rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California. I know that area. That's where they have a lot of truly rare earth. That's fantastic. I love that. And Apple will help develop and manufacture semiconductors and semiconductor equipment in Texas, Utah, Arizona, and New York.

( 10:49 ) For years, Americans have watched as many of our leading tech giants built their factories overseas and exported American jobs abroad. But under the Trump administration, we're doing everything possible

President Trump ( 11:00 ):

… Possible to make this the best place on earth to build a factory or grow businesses. I'm allowing them to build electric-producing plants with their factory because otherwise they'd have to hook into the grid. And I think it's one of the biggest things we've done where you can build, Tim, your own electricity. You become your own electric manufacturer, and that goes along with the plant so you become a utility. So congratulations, now you're in the utility. I hope they don't value your company based on utility, but that's okay. You're going to be making your own electricity. And as you probably know for much of this, and much of many of the things that we're doing, especially the AI, they would need actually double the electricity that the country now produces for everything. So it's massive electric and they're going to be able to make their own and they're getting very fast approvals.

( 11:54 ) Lee Zeldin is doing a fantastic job, including with a 100% expensing on the one Big Beautiful Bill. In return, we're asking our businesses to invest in America, and they're coming in at levels that we've never seen before. So I don't know when it shows up, but there are a lot of factories and a lot of plants that are either under construction or soon will be starting construction. So can't tell you exactly when, but I want to be around in about a year from now and two years from now, because we're going to see an explosion, I think, like this country has never seen before, never. Today's announcement is one of the largest commitments in what has become among the greatest investment booms in our nation's history, and we've got the hottest country anywhere in the world. I told you the story that, and Tim, I'll tell you, but I went to the Middle East and I was with Qatar, I was with UAE and the King of Saudi Arabia, all great leaders.

( 12:56 ) And then I went to NATO and saw many great leaders, and we just finished that about four weeks ago. Virtually everyone said, in effect, that we were a dead country one year ago. America, this was dead country. We were dying, we were dead. And now you've got the hottest country anywhere in the world. This would've never happened except for certain people. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

( 13:22 ) Nvidia is investing 500 billion to go along with Apple's 600 billion, 600 billion. Micron, great company, is investing 200 billion. IBM is investing more than 150 billion. SoftBank is investing substantially more than 100 billion. TSMC is investing 200 billion. Johnson & Johnson, 55 billion. Merck, Stellantis and General Motors are putting many, many billions in. They haven't determined the final number. And many other countries are investing tens of billions of dollars that I'm not going to give you the whole list because the list is too long to read, but it's hundreds of billions and even trillions. I mean, it's trillions of dollars that's being invested right now.

( 14:09 ) Last week it was announced that our economy grew at 3% in the second quarter, and consumer confidence is surging. Blue-collar wages are rising rapidly. Costs are way down. I listen to these horrendous frauds on CNN and various other fake news networks and they say, costs are up. No, no, costs are down. Gasoline is down. It's going to soon, I believe, be less than $2 a gallon. It's around 2.40 right now in many places other than in California where they tax you out of business, and a couple of others. But gasoline is way down. The price of groceries are down. How about eggs? When I first came here, my first week, the press hit me very hard on eggs. Eggs had quadrupled or something. I said, I didn't know about it. Give me a chance. I've just been here for four days. Well, eggs are down, everything's down, prices down.

( 15:09 ) The only thing that's up is stock prices. That's really up and that's through the roof. The stock market has been hitting all-time records, all-time highs. Last week it was announced that our economy grew at levels that we haven't seen in a long time, but the real levels of growth are going to be judged in a year from now when you start seeing some of these incredible plants, because we have car plants opening. They're coming in from Canada, from Mexico, and from all over the world. And they're coming in because they like the way the election worked out, but they also like the fact that they don't want to pay tariffs. And the tariffs, I think we'll be taking … Well, we're taken in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.

( 15:50 ) I won't be so specific other than to say, because we don't even know what the final number is. We just made a deal, as you know with the EU where they're paying hundreds of billions of dollars. Japan paying hundreds of billions of dollars and numerous other countries paying hundreds of billions of dollars and we're not even completed there. And as you know, they found 25 billion three weeks ago. They said, "We have a surplus of $25 billion." And they said, "Where did this come from?" I said, "Check the tariffs." And they checked. They said, "You're right. That's where it came from."

( 16:22 ) And we've really just started. This is just in its infancy. So we have a great country. We have a country that is going to be very rich. It's a country that we're very proud of, but it's going to be very rich. And it's companies like Apple, they're coming home. They're all coming home, and we want them to come home. They have to come home. We're going to treat them really well. We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors. But the good news for companies like Apple is if building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge. In other words, we're not going to be charging. So a lot of countries, a lot of companies are leaving various other places and they're coming to the United States.

( 17:15 ) So in other words, we'll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge. Even though you're building and you're not producing yet in terms of the big numbers of jobs and all of the things that you're building, if you're building, there will be no charge. So I just want everyone to know that. And I didn't even tell you that inside. We discussed the concept, but I didn't. So it's a big factor. So 100% tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States. But if you've made a commitment to build or if you're in the process of building as many are, there is no tariff. Okay? If for some reason you say you're building and you don't build, then we go back and get, we add it up, it accumulates, and we charge you at a later date. You have to pay. And that's a guarantee. So that's a big statement. And I think the chip companies are all coming back home. They're all coming back. We started with Intel, and gradually Intel was just taken over the coals. They were taken to the cleaners, frankly, and moved to other places, in particular Taiwan. But I think a lot of those companies are coming back and they're coming back very rapidly. So that's a big statement, 100% tariff. I want to thank you very much, Tim, would you like to say a few words about your company, please?

Tim Cook ( 18:50 ):

Good afternoon, everyone. Mr. President, thank you very much for having me here today. You've been a great advocate for American innovation and manufacturing and I'm grateful for your leadership and your commitment. That's a commitment we share at Apple because American innovation is central to everything we do. Our products are designed here. We're hiring and growing here, and we support 450,000 jobs with thousands of suppliers and partners in all 50 states. Earlier this year, we made our largest ever spending commitment, $500 billion to the U.S. over the next four years that's already yielding results. Earlier this year, we broke ground on a new factory in Houston to make advanced AI servers. And just last month, the very first test unit rolled off that factory's line, proudly made in America. President Trump shared some kind words about that work, but he also asked us to think about what more we could commit to doing.

( 19:55 ) And Mr. President, we took that challenge very seriously. I'm glad to be here with you today, and I'm very proud to say that today we're committing an additional 100 billion to the United States, bringing our total U.S. investment to 600 billion over the next four years. As a part of this, we're launching Apple's American manufacturing program. It will spur even more production right here in America for critical components used in Apple products all around the world. And we're thrilled to announce that we've already signed new agreements with 10 companies across America to do just that. First, with today's announcements, I'm proud to say that Apple is leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain right here in America from design to equipment, to wafer production, to fabrication, to packaging. In Texas, we're working with manufacturers like Texas Instruments, Global Wafers America, and Applied Materials. We're working with Amcor in Arizona and Broadcom and Global Foundries in New York.

( 21:06 ) Thanks to President Trump's vision and with his help in his first term, we also led the way to bring TSMC to Arizona by committing to be their first and largest customer. Today, they're producing tens of millions of chips for Apple using one of the most advanced process technologies in America today. We're going to keep working with our suppliers to move even more of this incredibly advanced work to America. And this year alone, American manufacturers are on track to make 19 billion chips for Apple in 24 factories across 12 different states. Second, we're committed to buying American-made advanced rare earth magnets developed by MP Materials, which will become part of Apple's devices shipped around

Tim Cook ( 22:00 ):

… in the world. MP is the only fully-integrated rare earth producer in the United States, and with this partnership, they'll be significantly expanding their flagship facility in Fort Worth, Texas.

( 22:13 ) We're also thrilled to work together on a cutting-edge rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California.

( 22:22 ) And third, in Kentucky, we've worked with our partners at Corning to build the world's largest and most advanced smartphone glass production line. And I'm pleased to announce that very soon, this is for the first time ever, every single new iPhone and every single new Apple Watch sold anywhere in the world will contain cover glass made in Kentucky.

( 22:47 ) In addition to the American manufacturing program, we're also significantly growing our investments in AI, including expanding data center capacity in North Carolina, in Nevada, in Iowa, in Arizona and Oregon.

( 23:02 ) So we're going to keep making investments right here in America. We're going to keep hiring in America, and we're going to keep building technologies at the heart of our products right here in America. Because we're a proud American company and we believe deeply in the promise of this great nation.

( 23:21 ) Thank you all, and thank you, President Trump, for pulling or for putting American innovation and American jobs front and center.

President Trump ( 23:29 ):

Thank you.

Tim Cook ( 23:29 ):

Thank you, sir.

President Trump ( 23:29 ):

Great honor.

Tim Cook ( 23:29 ):

Thank you.

President Trump ( 23:29 ):

Thank you very much.

Tim Cook ( 23:29 ):

Thank you.

President Trump ( 23:30 ):

Appreciate it.

( 23:30 ) What a job he's done. What a job. Incredible. I want to thank you very much, and thank you, JD, for helping along. Good job, really good job.

( 23:44 ) Any questions, please?

Speaker 9 ( 23:45 ):

Mr. President, Mr. President-

President Trump ( 23:46 ):

Yes.

Speaker 9 ( 23:46 ):

… you promised on the campaign trail to bring forth a manufacturing renaissance. You just mentioned $17 trillion in your first seven months or so.

( 23:55 ) Can you talk about how an investment like this, all the other ones that you laid out, will positively impact the millions of Americans that trusted you with their vote?

President Trump ( 24:03 ):

Thank you very much.

( 24:05 ) It changes our country. I mean, our country is a very different country than it was six months ago, and people like Tim are coming. We had Micron in yesterday. We had all of the big, great companies that you read about, you don't know about, but you read about. Many of them were making products outside of our country.

( 24:25 ) Foolishly, we lost them. If we had the right person sitting in that seat, that would've never happened 20 and 30 years ago when you look at the chip business. It would've never left our shores. We had a hundred percent of chips originally, and then we slowly got taken down to nothing.

( 24:42 ) We have the biggest chip companies, the both of them, but we have the biggest in the world coming in. They're going to Arizona and beyond, and we're going to have, in a short period of time, we'll be up to almost 50% of the chips from starting in nothing, and that's something.

( 24:58 ) But we have the greatest companies in the world coming into our country, and that means jobs and it means wealth, and wealth means security for our people, okay?

( 25:07 ) Brian?

Brian ( 25:07 ):

Yes, sir. Congratulations on this investment, President Trump, and-

President Trump ( 25:11 ):

Thank you.

Brian ( 25:12 ):

… what a great example of putting America first.

( 25:16 ) What does a labor force look like to fill these jobs that you have? Do we have enough skilled American workers to fill these?

President Trump ( 25:23 ):

Well, we do have a lot of workers, and we have a lot of workers that hadn't been looking for work because they were disincentivized, frankly. And people like Tim have tremendous schools and training centers that they build, along with a lot of their big plants, where they train people on, whether it's glass like in Kentucky or computers or whatever they might be doing. It's a complex world and they train people and they do a great job. So it's a whole new workforce.

( 25:52 ) Now we have a lot of them in energy because they've always liked energy. As you know, coal has opened up and opened up big. We brought it back and brought it back in a very large way. You know, China's right now building 58 coal-fired plants, 58 big ones. And here we were saying, we don't take coal.

( 26:10 ) We have more coal than anybody else in the world. We have more oil and gas than anybody else in the world. But we have tremendous energy jobs and the energy, as you know, we're booming with energy. And that's why the gasoline prices are down. Costs are down.

( 26:24 ) I just hope when they watch these shows, I watch this, I won't use names because I just make them better known that nobody knows who they are. But I watched this group of people on CNN and MSDNC, too, the same thing, where they say, "Well, costs have gone up." Costs haven't gone up. They've gone down.

( 26:44 ) I'm telling you, the thing that's gone up is stock, stock prices and success of our country. Our country is really, really doing well, successful.

( 26:54 ) Yes, ma'am?

Speaker 4 ( 26:58 ):

Yes. Mr. President, have Putin and Zelensky agreed to a summit yet? And where and when would that be? What would that-

President Trump ( 27:01 ):

Well, there's a very good prospect that they will, and we haven't determined where. But we had some very good talks with President Putin today, and there's a very good chance that we could be ending the round, ending the end of that road.

( 27:17 ) That road was long and continues to be long, but there's a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon.

Speaker 4 ( 27:24 ):

How close do you think you are to a deal?

President Trump ( 27:25 ):

Excuse me?

Speaker 4 ( 27:26 ):

How close do you think you are to some kind of deal?

President Trump ( 27:28 ):

Well, look, I don't want to say. I've been disappointed before with this one.

( 27:32 ) You know, we've solved five wars, plus add to that Iran, where we wiped out their nuclear capacity for weapons. They would've had a weapon within two months, maybe less, and that was totally obliterated. Turned out it was a total obliteration, and the pilots and the people that did that job, really, we have the greatest armed forces in the world, but that was really something.

( 27:59 ) In fact, there's a model of the plane right there. You got to bring that up, Susie. We have to see that. Look at this. This was just given to me. You know, we ordered brand new B2 bombers.

( 28:15 ) This is a plane that, over a period of 36 hours of constant flying, look at this. This is the brand new one. They just ordered similar, but actually quite different. It's new and enhanced. It's an amazing machine. It went 36 hours.

( 28:34 ) We had 52 tankers up in the air loading up our planes because this was surrounded by F22s and F35s, and it was flawless, Tim. Even you would say it was flawless. And every one of those bombs hit their target.

( 28:48 ) And then we had Tomahawks shot in from a submarine 300 miles away, and they hit, every single Tomahawk hit its target. It was amazing. And that was a big threat. That was a nuclear threat.

( 29:03 ) And here's the new one that we just ordered, a large number of them. I'll put it up.

Speaker 5 ( 29:12 ):

Mr. President, what was the breakthrough today? Did Vladimir Putin make some kind of concession that he hasn't been willing to make before?

President Trump ( 29:20 ):

I don't call it a breakthrough. I mean, we've been working at this a long time. There are thousands of young people dying, mostly soldiers, but also missiles being hit into Kyiv and other places.

( 29:31 ) But in terms of soldiers, I think Russia has lost over 20,000 since the beginning of the year, 20,000. And I guess the estimate for Ukraine is about 9,000. It's a terrible situation. We want to get it stopped.

( 29:46 ) You know, we don't have American soldiers there, but I feel I have an obligation to get it stopped. This was not my war. This war would've never started. Not even a chance. And it didn't start for four years. It went four years, and it didn't start. But this is Biden's war. This was on his watch.

( 30:06 ) And you know it's funny. No land was taken from Trump. It was taken from Bush. It was taken from Biden. The whole thing they would take from Biden if it weren't for us. And it was taken by Obama. Take a look at what was taken, with all of the land that was taken. Nothing was taken by Russia from us. Not one ounce of land was taken.

( 30:29 ) I'm here to get the thing over with. It would've never started if I were president and we're here to get it stopped and get the deaths stopped.

( 30:37 ) Yeah, please.

Speaker 6 ( 30:37 ):

Okay. Mr. President, in the past you said you would know if who Putin was happy to move on.

President Trump ( 30:40 ):

Yep.

Speaker 6 ( 30:40 ):

What gives you any confidence that he is or isn't doing that this time around?

President Trump ( 30:47 ):

Can't answer the question yet. I'll tell you in a matter of weeks, maybe less, but we've made a lot of progress.

( 30:53 ) And as you know, we put a 50% tariff on India on oil. They're the second largest. They're very close to China in terms of the purchase of oil from Russia. So I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but we've had very productive talks today.

( 31:08 ) Yes, ma'am?

Speaker 7 ( 31:09 ):

President Trump, on capitalizing DC, are you considering taking over the DC Police? Is that an option on the table?

President Trump ( 31:15 ):

We're considering it, yeah, because the crime is ridiculous. I could show you a chart comparing DC to other locations, and you're not going to want to see what it looks like. It was just up on television, actually. They were showing it. Now we want to have a great safe capital, and we're going to have it. And that includes cleanliness and includes other things.

( 31:36 ) We have a capital that's very unsafe. You know we just almost lost a young man, beautiful, handsome guy that got the hell knocked out of him the night before last, and I'm going to call him now. We wanted to give him a little recovery time. We just put a call into him. They're calling back a little while. But he went through a bad situation, to put it mildly, and there's too much of it. We're going to do something about it. So whether you call it federalized or what.

( 32:09 ) And that also includes the graffiti that you see, the papers all over the place, the roads that are in bad shape, the medians that are falling down, the median in between roads, that's falling down. We're going to beautify the city. We're going to make it beautiful.

( 32:24 ) And what a shame, the rate of crime, the rate of muggings, killings and everything else. We're not going to let it. And that includes bringing in the National Guard maybe very quickly, too.

Speaker 7 ( 32:36 ):

And do you want Congress to look at overturning the DC Home Rule Act?

President Trump ( 32:41 ):

We're going to look at that. In fact, the lawyers are already studying it.

( 32:45 ) We have to run DC. This has to be the best-run place in the country, not the worst-run place in the country. And it has so much potential, and we're going to take care of it. You're going to be safe. You're going to be safe walking down the streets.

President Trump ( 33:00 ):

… you're not going to get mugged.

Speaker 8 ( 33:01 ):

Mr. President, if you do reach a deal with Ukraine and Russia, would you drop the additional tariffs on India?

President Trump ( 33:07 ):

Well, we'll determine that later, but right now they're paying a 50% tariff. Okay.

Speaker 8 ( 33:14 ):

One for Mr. Cook as well, if I may.

President Trump ( 33:16 ):

Yeah, please. Sure.

Speaker 8 ( 33:18 ):

The President wants a made in the USA iPhone. What are the chances that you can actually make that happen?

Tim Cook ( 33:24 ):

Well, if you look at the bulk of it, we're doing a lot of the semiconductors here. We're doing the glass here, we're doing the face ID module here, and so there's a ton of it. And we're doing these for products sold elsewhere in the world. And so there's a lot of content in there from the United States.

Speaker 8 ( 33:43 ):

But what about the whole thing?

Tim Cook ( 33:44 ):

We're very proud of it.

Speaker 8 ( 33:45 ):

Can you make the whole thing here?

Tim Cook ( 33:46 ):

The whole thing is just the final assembly that you're focused on, and that will be elsewhere for a while.

President Trump ( 33:54 ):

He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it and the whole thing is set up at other places and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all. But I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that. But he brings most of the stuff. Look, he's not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world. Not even close. He's coming back. I mean, Apple is coming back to America. Thank you.

Speaker 10 ( 34:19 ):

Mr. President, Indian officials have said-

President Trump ( 34:24 ):

Let me go, please.

Speaker 10 ( 34:25 ):

Indian officials have said that there are other countries that are buying Russian oil.

President Trump ( 34:29 ):

It's okay. It's okay.

Speaker 10 ( 34:29 ):

Like China, for instance, buys more.

President Trump ( 34:31 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 10 ( 34:32 ):

Why are you singling India out for these additional sanctions?

President Trump ( 34:35 ):

It's only been eight hours, so let's see what happens over the next-

Speaker 10 ( 34:39 ):

We're going to see more secondary sanctions very soon?

President Trump ( 34:40 ):

Yeah. Yeah. You're going to see a lot more.

Speaker 10 ( 34:41 ):

So this is a taste of what's to come?

President Trump ( 34:42 ):

You're going to see a lot more. You're going to see-

Speaker 11 ( 34:44 ):

Mr. President, you were the driving-

President Trump ( 34:44 ):

… so much secondary sanctions. Yes, ma'am?

Speaker 11 ( 34:47 ):

Sorry. You were the driving force behind Operation Warp Speed, these mRNA vaccines that are the gold standard.

President Trump ( 34:54 ):

Right.

Speaker 11 ( 34:54 ):

Now, your health secretary is pulling back all the funding for research. He's saying that the risks outweigh the benefits, which puts him at odds with-

President Trump ( 35:02 ):

Research on what?

Speaker 11 ( 35:03 ):

… the entire medical community and with you. What is going on?

President Trump ( 35:06 ):

Yeah. Research on what?

Speaker 11 ( 35:07 ):

Into mRNA vaccines.

President Trump ( 35:09 ):

Well, we're going to look at that. We're talking about it and they're doing a very good job. And that is a pass. Operation Warp Speed was, whether you're Republican or Democrat, considered one of the most incredible things ever done in this country. The efficiency, the way it was done, the distribution, everything about it has been amazing. But that was now a long time ago and we're onto other things. But we are speaking about it. We have meetings about it tomorrow, actually tomorrow 12:00, and we'll determine. We're looking for other answers to other problems, to other sicknesses and diseases, and I think we're doing really well. Yes, ma'am, please.

Speaker 12 ( 35:53 ):

Thank you. Mr. President. You said many times that you want to stop wars in the Middle East. Now, Prime Minister Netanyahu is contemplating reoccupying Gaza entirely. Is he defying you, sir, or are you giving him a green light?

President Trump ( 36:06 ):

Well, we have stopped wars in the Middle East by stopping Iran from having a nuclear weapon. And they can say they're going to start all over again, but that's a very dangerous thing for them to do because we'll be back. As soon as they start, we'll be back. And I think they understand that, they're just words. But no, we've stopped a lot of wars in the Middle East. If you think about what we did with Iran, Iran was the perpetrator of hate, a very evil place, and I think it's going to be a lot different in the coming years.

Speaker 14 ( 36:39 ):

Mr. President, did you walk to-

Speaker 13 ( 36:41 ):

Mr. President, on the India penalties, do you have any similar plans to enact more tariffs on China as it relates to their-

President Trump ( 36:48 ):

Could happen. Could happen.

Speaker 13 ( 36:48 ):

… purchases.

President Trump ( 36:49 ):

Depends on how we do. Could happen.

Speaker 14 ( 36:51 ):

Mr. President, have you talked to-

President Trump ( 36:52 ):

Brian. Brian.

Speaker 15 ( 36:52 ):

I've got an entertainment-based question for you. A few weeks ago, Stephen Colbert announced that he was leaving his show. Howard Stern announced that he had been SiriusXM Radio are parting ways. Do you think the hate Trump business model that's been in the entertainment business is going out of business because it's not popular with the American people?

President Trump ( 37:13 ):

Well, it hasn't worked and it hasn't worked really for a long time. And I would say pretty much from the beginning, Colbert has no talent. I mean, I could take anybody here, I could go outside on the beautiful streets and pick up a couple of people that do just as well or better. They get higher ratings than he did. He's got no talent. Fallon has no talent. Kimmel has no talent. They're next. They're going to be going. I hear they're going to be going. I don't know, but I would imagine because they get… Colbert has better ratings than Kimmel or Fallon, you know that. Howard Stern?, It's the name I haven't heard. I used to do his show, we used to have fun, but I haven't heard that name in a long time. What happened, he got terminated?

Speaker 15 ( 37:50 ):

Yeah. They're going to separate ways because I think what they're offering salary wise is real low from what he's getting now.

President Trump ( 37:55 ):

You know when he went down?

Speaker 15 ( 37:56 ):

[inaudible 00:37:59]

President Trump ( 37:59 ):

You know when he went down? No, before. When he endorsed Hillary Clinton-

Speaker 15 ( 38:02 ):

[inaudible 00:38:03].

President Trump ( 38:03 ):

… he lost his audience. People said, "Give me a break." He went down when he endorsed Hillary Clinton.

Speaker 14 ( 38:09 ):

Mr. President, have you talked to Governor Cuomo-

Speaker 16 ( 38:10 ):

… started interviewing fed candidates yet? And how do you [inaudible 00:38:14]

President Trump ( 38:13 ):

Yeah, we started the interviewing process. Scott and I and Howard, a lot of people, JD, we have some great candidates. It's probably down to three. He doesn't want the job. He said, "I like…" Do you like this job better?

Speaker 17 ( 38:31 ):

Yes, sir.

President Trump ( 38:32 ):

I mean, he was a candidate, but I don't think he'll take it.

Speaker 16 ( 38:36 ):

Are there any candidates from-

President Trump ( 38:37 ):

I really don't think he'd take it, actually.

Speaker 16 ( 38:40 ):

Are there any candidates from Wall Street, Mr. President?

President Trump ( 38:41 ):

Yeah. Essentially we're all from Wall Street, aren't we? You know when you get right down to it, the term Wall Street?

Speaker 18 ( 38:47 ):

Mr. President?

President Trump ( 38:47 ):

Yeah, please.

Speaker 18 ( 38:48 ):

Yep. You made your tax cuts permanent. You mentioned that the tariffs are bringing in a ton of external revenue. You've opened up markets, EU, Japan, South Korea, many others, American goods like we've never seen before. How much growth can we expect in the economy now that this model of yours is sort of beginning to really take off?

President Trump ( 39:06 ):

Well, I think the growth is going to be unprecedented. I think we're going to have growth that's unbelievable. Now remember, we're building and just starting to build a lot of these incredible plants. We talked about the electric facilities that we're building, the generating plants, electric generating plants are massive and they're going to be great. And they're going to sell electricity into our grid, so we're going to be having much more electricity than we ever had. And those plants are going to be taken care of individually. I know Tim is building one in one of his big factories, but especially for AI because it needs so much electricity. So I appreciate the question very much. I think the growth is going to be unprecedented.

Speaker 14 ( 39:47 ):

Mr. President, did talk to Governor Cuomo about his New York City mayoral run?

Speaker 19 ( 39:50 ):

Mr. President, did you have a phone call with Andrew Cuomo? Did you speak to Andrew Cuomo?

President Trump ( 39:51 ):

I haven't. No, I haven't.

Speaker 20 ( 39:53 ):

Mr. President, have you been briefed on what? Ghislaine Maxwell told Todd Blanche?

President Trump ( 39:57 ):

No, I haven't. Have not.

Speaker 20 ( 39:59 ):

So you don't know whether you came up in the conversation or not?

President Trump ( 40:00 ):

I know Todd is a very respected person all over the country, all over the world, legally. So, I don't know.

Speaker 21 ( 40:06 ):

Mr. President.

President Trump ( 40:07 ):

Yeah, please go ahead.

Speaker 21 ( 40:08 ):

Will the new governor be temporary?

President Trump ( 40:12 ):

We are probably going to go with a temp and then a permanent, I think.

Speaker 21 ( 40:16 ):

Are the two Kevins-

President Trump ( 40:17 ):

So the temp is going to be named, I'd say over the next two, three days, and then we're going to go permanent.

Speaker 21 ( 40:28 ):

Are the two Kevins the leading contenders for the permanent spot for the chair?

President Trump ( 40:29 ):

Well, the two Kevins? The two Kevins are absolutely, yeah. They're both very good.

Speaker 22 ( 40:33 ):

Mr. President-

President Trump ( 40:33 ):

The two Kevins, very good.

Speaker 23 ( 40:36 ):

Mr. President, is Vice President Vance hosting a gathering this evening to talk about how to respond to the Epstein situation?

President Trump ( 40:41 ):

Is he working on what?

Speaker 13 ( 40:42 ):

Is he hosting some kind of gathering of top advisors this evening to talk about how to respond to the Epstein situation?

President Trump ( 40:48 ):

I don't know. I could ask you that question. I don't know of it, but I think… Here's the man, right?

Speaker 24 ( 40:55 ):

I saw it reported today, and it's completely fake news. We're not meeting to talk about the Epstein situation. And I think the reporter who reported it needs to get better sources.

Speaker 25 ( 41:05 ):

On that topic-

President Trump ( 41:06 ):

Look, the whole thing is a hoax. It's put out by the Democrats because we've had the most successful six months in the history of our country, and that's just a way of trying to divert attention to something that's total bullshit. Okay?

Speaker 25 ( 41:21 ):

On that topic-

President Trump ( 41:21 ):

Yeah, please.

Speaker 8 ( 41:22 ):

A new Gallup poll says that Elon Musk is the most unpopular public figure in the country right now. I'm wondering, do you miss having him around the White House or is that poll accurate?

President Trump ( 41:34 ):

I don't know if the poll's accurate. I think he's a good person. I think he had a bad moment, really bad moment. But he's a good person. I believe that.

Speaker 23 ( 41:43 ):

President Trump, are you keeping that 10 and 12 day-

Speaker 27 ( 41:46 ):

China's facing potential secondary sanctions for [inaudible 00:41:49] Russian oil? Them having that tariff or sanction rather or not hinges on what going forward?

President Trump ( 41:54 ):

It may. I mean, I don't know. I can't tell you yet, but we did it with India. We're doing it probably with a couple of others. One of them could be China. Yes.

Speaker 26 ( 42:07 ):

Are you keeping that 10 to 12-day deadline that you had given Russia after today's talks?

President Trump ( 42:10 ):

Yeah, we're pretty much getting close to it right now, but we're having very serious talks right now about getting out of Ukraine, getting it settled, getting it ended. Should have never started, would've never started. If I were president, it would've never started. I want to thank Tim Cook, he's a great, great man, a visionary, a businessman, just about every quality he can have other than athleticism. I don't know about that. I'm looking at him. I'm not a hundred percent sure about. You're a good athlete? I'll bet you're pretty good. I think he's good at everything, but I want to thank you very much, Tim.

Tim Cook ( 42:43 ):

Thank you, sir.

President Trump ( 42:44 ):

Congratulations. Thank you all very much.

Speaker 28 ( 42:45 ):

Thank you press. Thank you press. Thanks guys. [inaudible 00:43:19] Thank you guys. Thanks everybody. Thank you press. [inaudible 00:43:19] Thank you. Thanks guys. Right behind you. Thanks guys [inaudible 00:43:19]. Thank you press. Thank you press.
