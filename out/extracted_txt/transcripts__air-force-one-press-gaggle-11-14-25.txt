Speaker 1 ( 00:02 ):

Mr. President.

Speaker 2 ( 00:04 ):

Good evening.

Speaker 3 ( 00:04 ):

Evening, sir.

Speaker 4 ( 00:05 ):

Hello everybody, how are you? How are you? Can you turn that down please? Too much, too much. Okay.

Speaker 1 ( 00:12 ):

Mr. President, what did Jeffrey Epstein mean in his emails when you said, "You knew about the girls."?

Speaker 4 ( 00:18 ):

I know nothing about that, they would've announced that a long time ago. It's really what did he mean when he spent all the time with Bill Clinton, with the president of Harvard, who you know that is Summers, Larry Summers, whatever his name is, and all of the other people that he spent time with? Jeffrey Epstein and I had a very bad relationship for many years, but he also saw a strike because I was president, so he dictated a couple of memos to himself, give me a break.

( 00:47 ) You're going to find out what did he know with respect to Bill Clinton, with respect to the head of Harvard, with respect to all of those people that he knew, including JP Morgan Chase? Yeah, Jennifer, go ahead, go ahead.

Speaker 1 ( 00:59 ):

Sir, if there's nothing incriminating in the file [inaudible 00:01:02], why not act like-

Speaker 4 ( 01:03 ):

Quiet, quiet [inaudible 00:01:04]. Go ahead.

Speaker 5 ( 01:04 ):

On Venezuela, Sir, you've had a lot of meetings on Venezuela. I know you can't tell us what your next steps will be, but can you say, have you made up your mind on what you'd like to do as far as action for Venezuela?

Speaker 4 ( 01:16 ):

I've sort of have made up my mind, yeah. I can't tell you what it would be, but I sort of made up my mind.

Speaker 5 ( 01:21 ):

What do you say to some of your supporters who might not be excited about another foreign campaign?

Speaker 4 ( 01:25 ):

We'll see what happens. I can't tell you what it is, but we made a lot of progress with Venezuela in terms of stopping drugs from pouring in, but we have a Mexico problem, we have a Colombia problem, meaning Colombia the country. We're doing very well, drugs coming into our country are greatly slowed, as you can imagine.

Speaker 6 ( 01:47 ):

On the tariffs on that, Sir, does the signal only change on your message for affordability for-

Speaker 4 ( 01:53 ):

No, I just want to bring down some of the foods. Look, for the most part, the foods when we cut back a little bit on those tariffs, we'll get the price down, but they're not competitive in this country like tomatoes and bananas and things. We don't make them in this country, so there's no protection of our industries or our food products. So what we're going to do is we cut back, you'll see prices come down even lower. You have to understand, we've all suffered from the Biden prices, which we're much higher than they are right now, but I'll be able to get them down even lower, at least a little bit more, possibly in some cases, a lot lower.

Speaker 6 ( 02:29 ):

More rollbacks in the future, with your tariff policies.

Speaker 4 ( 02:31 ):

Will who?

Speaker 6 ( 02:32 ):

Will there be more rollbacks in the future, will you change anything else with tariffs?

Speaker 4 ( 02:36 ):

I don't think it will be necessary, we just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee, a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time. We're very good at this. The problem is we inherited a country when we took over January 20th where the prices were through the roof, so they were up 30%, 40%, 50%. If we got them down 30%, that means they're still higher than where they were. We had a great four years, and I think this is going to be even much better.

( 03:10 ) And in terms of affordability, it's not a good word for the Democrats, it's a good word for us because our prices are much lower and will certainly be much, much lower than they were under the Democrats.

Speaker 7 ( 03:22 ):

Mr President, my newspaper, The Telegraph, has led the way and exposed-

Speaker 4 ( 03:26 ):

Are you The Telegraph?

Speaker 7 ( 03:27 ):

Yes, sir-

Speaker 4 ( 03:27 ):

Oh, what a job you did, what a job you did.

Speaker 7 ( 03:32 ):

We led-

Speaker 4 ( 03:32 ):

Are you proud of yourselves?

Speaker 7 ( 03:34 ):

We've had a good-

Speaker 4 ( 03:34 ):

How did you catch BBC like that?

Speaker 7 ( 03:37 ):

Well, we have good sources-

Speaker 4 ( 03:39 ):

Honestly, congratulations, you did a great service to a lot of countries, a lot of great human beings, if you want to know the truth. And exposing what fake news is all about what BBC did, nobody would even think a thing like that done. They actually changed the words coming out of my mouth.

Speaker 7 ( 03:57 ):

So the BBC has apologized and retracted the report, but they say they won't pay any compensation.

Speaker 4 ( 04:04 ):

Well, we'll sue them, we'll sue them for anywhere between $1 billion and $5 billion probably sometime next week.

Speaker 7 ( 04:11 ):

So you're ready to take on-

Speaker 4 ( 04:12 ):

Well, I think I have to do it. They've even admitted that they cheated. Not that they couldn't have not done that. They cheated, they changed the words coming out of my mouth. That's worse than what CBS did with Kamala. They changed her answer, but at least they didn't show coming out of her mouth.

Speaker 7 ( 04:31 ):

Do you think it's appropriate that British TV viewers have to pay more than $200 just for the right to watch television, do you think the license fees-

Speaker 4 ( 04:39 ):

Well, I don't know what they do in a place that I like a lot, the general UK, but the people of the UK are very angry about what happened, as you can imagine, because it shows that BBC is fake news. Of course, you and I knew that for a long time, but we didn't know it was this fake.

Speaker 7 ( 04:59 ):

Have you raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer?

Speaker 4 ( 05:03 ):

I have not, but I'll call him. I'm going to call him over the weekend. He actually would've called it to me. He's very embarrassed by it. I don't know what percentage is owed by the country, but regardless if it's small or large or nothing, I can say this, the UK is very, very embarrassed by BBC, what they did.

Speaker 8 ( 05:22 ):

Mr. president, you've said that the tariffs do not increase prices for consumers, but now you're lowering tariffs.

Speaker 4 ( 05:29 ):

I didn't say they don't. I say they may in some cases, but to a large extent they've been borne by the country. As an example, we have virtually no inflation, and yet we've taken in hundreds of millions of dollars, so we've taken in hundreds of millions of dollars, we've used tariffs to stop wars. You look at India, Pakistan, look at so many wars I stopped just by saying, "I'm going to impose tariffs on your country if you're going to have a war." In that case it was nuclear war, and I stopped it by using tariffs.

( 06:01 ) But oftentimes, and to a large extent, the countries themselves pick up the tab, the companies pick up the tab, and I find that based on inflation, we have virtually no inflation. When I inherited the country from Sleepy Joe Biden, the inflation, it was the highest inflation in the history of our country, or at least 48 years. I use 48, I say it was the history. We have now a low inflation, going to be very soon even lower, but we'll get some of the prices down a little bit, which will bring them down to a new low.

Speaker 8 ( 06:39 ):

How much of the tab will be picked up by Americans?

Speaker 4 ( 06:43 ):

I think very little, I really think very little. If you look at it, and when you add the trillions of dollars that our country is making, when you add the fact that I'll be giving back $2,000 or so to middle-income people, low-income people, everybody but the rich, we'll be giving $2,000 back and you add that in, when you add the fact that our country's extremely rich and we have no wars and we're respected again, when you add the fact that when China was threatening to us in terms of rare earths, I was able to solve it just by putting tariffs on China, and we made a deal a week later.

( 07:20 ) When you add all of the benefits, the single greatest thing we have right now is the use of tariffs, and I use them properly. For years, they've been used against us, and I think whether you call them tariffs or anything else, if you didn't use them, you really would've an unguarded disaster in your hands.

Speaker 8 ( 07:42 ):

Well, those $2,000 payments, will that be inflationary? Because previously Republicans have said that's sending money to people. [inaudible 00:07:49].

Speaker 4 ( 07:49 ):

Well, the difference is this is money earned as opposed to money that was made up. That money was made up. Biden gave the Inflation Reduction Act, which did not reduce inflation and it wasn't meant to, and they admitted it was a phony name, but they spent hundreds of billions of dollars on a fake deal called the Inflation Reduction Act. That was made up money. When I pay people $2,000 each for low and moderate income and middle-income people, everybody but the rich who get this, that's not made up, that's real money, that comes from other countries.

Speaker 5 ( 08:27 ):

Speaking of China, since you made the deal, since you struck the deal with them, has the Chinese agreed to actually purchase any soybeans? Have they locked in any soybean purchases?

Speaker 4 ( 08:36 ):

Yeah, and they're in the process of doing it. We spoke to them today. They're in the process of doing not only a little bit, but they'll be doing a lot of soybean purchase.

Speaker 5 ( 08:45 ):

Do you know when? In the spring?

Speaker 4 ( 08:46 ):

It's starting, before then. It's starting. They'll be buying a lot of soybeans, but really, Jennifer, a lot of everything else.

Speaker 5 ( 08:54 ):

Can you say who you spoke with or who your team spoke with?

Speaker 4 ( 08:58 ):

Top of the line. Top of the line.

Speaker 9 ( 09:01 ):

Just on the rebate checks, sir, how soon could Americans see those checks? Will that be in time for Christmas, holiday shopping?

Speaker 4 ( 09:07 ):

No, no, not for this year, it'll be next year sometime.

Speaker 9 ( 09:09 ):

Do you have a timeframe, like eight months?

Speaker 4 ( 09:12 ):

Sometime during the year next year. It's a lot of money, but we've taken in a lot of money from tariffs. The tariffs allow us to give a dividend if we want to do that. Now, we're going to do a dividend and we're also going to be reducing debt. Because of Biden and others, we have a $37 trillion in debt, so we're going to be doing a dividend, which people will enjoy and spend and do what they want, but we're also going to be reducing debt very substantially.

Speaker 9 ( 09:40 ):

What if the Supreme Court rules against you, sir? Is there any plans?

Speaker 4 ( 09:43 ):

Well, then I'd have to do something else. We'll have to figure something else. That'll be a very sad day for our country. Just today, I stopped a war. I won't go into which one, but you'll be able to figure it out.

Speaker 9 ( 09:57 ):

Cambodia, Thailand.

Speaker 4 ( 09:58 ):

But I… That was quick, you're very smart. Good, thank you. But just today, I stopped a war by the use of tariffs. Oftentimes, I'm able to do that, and if you think of the cost of war, just forget about death, which is number one, but the death within those countries, but that all comes to our, in one form or another, it all comes right back to us. I stopped the war just today through the use of tariffs, the threat of tariffs. If we didn't have that, other countries would use tariffs on us and we would have no fair means of fighting back.

Speaker 9 ( 10:32 ):

Is that confirmation that Cambodia and Thailand, you stopped doing?

Speaker 4 ( 10:35 ):

They're doing great.

Speaker 10 ( 10:36 ):

Mr. president-

Speaker 4 ( 10:37 ):

They were not doing great, and then they had a conflict, as you know?

Speaker 9 ( 10:41 ):

Yes, sir.

Speaker 4 ( 10:42 ):

And I spoke to the prime ministers of both countries and they're doing great. I think they're going to be fine.

Speaker 10 ( 10:49 ):

Mr. President, what are you doing on healthcare subsidies? Obviously, people's NCA premiums-

Speaker 4 ( 10:53 ):

Yeah, health subsidies is a good question. So Obamacare, which is the Unaffordable Care Act, it is totally unaffordable. You see the kind of money the insurance companies are making, hundreds of billions of dollars. Their stock is up over a thousand percent over a relatively short period of time. What we are going to be doing, what I'm going to be recommending, not this, Obamacare is a disaster, far too expensive and lousy healthcare. We're going to give the money to the people to buy their own healthcare, and the kind of money that we give to the insurance companies is more than going to take care of it. People are going to be able to buy their own health insurance and it's going to be great healthcare, and they're going to get paid by the government.

( 11:41 ) The government will be doing, it would be one of the greatest deals this country's ever made, so instead of giving it to insurance companies, big, fat, bloated insurance companies, we are giving the money directly to the people to buy their own healthcare.

Speaker 8 ( 11:57 ):

Won't Americans buy it from insurance companies?

Speaker 4 ( 12:00 ):

Some may, they'll be negotiating prices. It's really free enterprise. You can do it through an insurance company, you can also buy it direct. They have savings accounts, they have a lot of different ways of buying healthcare.

Speaker 8 ( 12:13 ):

Another question though. You asked for an investigation today, the people associated with Epstein.

Speaker 4 ( 12:17 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 8 ( 12:18 ):

Like Reid Hoffman, a major democratic [inaudible 00:12:20].

Speaker 4 ( 12:20 ):

Right?

Speaker 8 ( 12:20 ):

What impact do you hope that that kind investigation can have on next year's [inaudible 00:12:24]?

Speaker 4 ( 12:24 ):

I don't know, but I heard are appointing a US attorney and I hear a really good one to look into it. I hear Southern District is going to be looking to Jay Clayton and he's a great man, a great attorney, and one of the most respected people in the country in terms of law and law enforcement. As you know, he headed up the SEC. He was the head of Sullivan & Cromwell for years. He's one of the most respected people in the country. He's been confirmed for the Southern district, and I heard Jay is going to be looking into it. Jay Clayton is a real legal talent and a very, very legitimate person.

Speaker 8 ( 13:03 ):

Do you believe that presidents should be able to award investigations?

Speaker 4 ( 13:05 ):

Sure, I'm the chief law enforcement officer of the country. Not that I want to use that, but I am considered the chief law enforcement agent in the country and I'm allowed to do it. I don't want to do it, I'm not doing it, I had nothing to do with that choice. As an example, that came from Pam Bondi from the DOJ, but you can't pick a better person than Jay Clayton. He's truly one of the most respected people in that world.

Speaker 1 ( 13:35 ):

Have you rolled out the tracking the Georgia RICO case at all? Did you see the news on that today?

Speaker 4 ( 13:39 ):

Which one?

Speaker 1 ( 13:40 ):

The Georgia case, the RICO case. Apparently they're continuing with the investigation into you and your allies related to the 2020 election. You're not tracking that?

Speaker 4 ( 13:48 ):

You mean the Fani Willis case?

Speaker 1 ( 13:49 ):

I think so.

Speaker 4 ( 13:51 ):

I can't imagine it, I thought that case was over. I was told that case was totally over.

Speaker 1 ( 13:55 ):

Mr. President, have you ruled out a pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell?

Speaker 4 ( 13:59 ):

I haven't even thought about it. I haven't thought about it for months. Maybe I haven't thought about it at all, you're just asking me a question.

Speaker 1 ( 14:07 ):

Why can't you rule it out?

Speaker 4 ( 14:07 ):

But I don't talk about that. I don't rule it in or out, I don't even think about it.

Speaker 3 ( 14:12 ):

On Epstein, Sir, I've seen Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Congresswoman was on CBS News, she was talking about how the files should be released, we anticipate that a vote will happen in the house. I know you [inaudible 00:14:24] about the investigation today.

Speaker 4 ( 14:25 ):

I don't care about it released or not. What I think you should do if you're going to do it, then you have to go into Epstein's friends. This Reid Hoffman spent a lot of time on the island. I was never on his island. Bill Clinton went there supposedly 28 times. You're going to have to look into his friends, if they're going to do that, and I think the perfect guy to do it would be Southern District, somebody like Jay Clayton. I understand that's who's been assigned.

Speaker 3 ( 14:54 ):

But does the Congresswoman have a point though?

Speaker 12 ( 14:55 ):

[inaudible 00:14:57].

Speaker 4 ( 14:57 ):

Does Marjorie Taylor Greene have a point?

Speaker 12 ( 14:59 ):

Does she have a point though?

Speaker 4 ( 15:00 ):

I know nothing about her.

Speaker 12 ( 15:03 ):

On the release of all the files?

Speaker 4 ( 15:05 ):

Well, they can have whatever they want. They already do. I think they have 50,000 pages already. Look, this is a Democrat hoax. This is a hoax put out by the Democrat and a couple of few Republicans have gone along with it because they're weak and ineffective, but this is a Democrat hoax to get away from the fact that they just lost the shutdown and they've lost the elections. They've lost the big election to me in a record number. They lost the popular vote, they lost the swing states, they lost everything. I think it was 312 to 220-something.

( 15:39 ) So this is a way of not talking about that, it's a hoax. This is no different than Russia, Russia, Russia, and it's headed up by Democrats and some very weak Republicans.

Speaker 1 ( 15:51 ):

I was just wondering if you have a timeline-

Speaker 4 ( 15:52 ):

Very few.

Speaker 1 ( 15:53 ):

A timeline for when you might release more of those files.

Speaker 4 ( 15:56 ):

Which ones?

Speaker 1 ( 15:56 ):

Democrats to Epstein.

Speaker 4 ( 15:58 ):

I don't know about those files. I know nothing about it, but I understand they released like 40,000 or 50,000 pages already and nobody… I will say this, if they had anything, they would've used it before the election. I can't tell you what they put in since the election, but if they had anything you don't think they would've used it before the election? They would've gladly used it before the election. Jennifer, go ahead.

Speaker 5 ( 16:26 ):

Why were you or why was your team encouraging Congresswoman Boebert and Congresswoman Mace to not pursue this?

Speaker 4 ( 16:33 ):

Because we think it's bad to talk about it because it gets away from the subject of how well the Republicans are doing. We have the greatest economy, we have the largest investment ever made in our country's history, we have all of these great things happen. We have very little inflation, whereas he had record-setting, the biggest inflation in history. All of these things are good, and when you talk about the Epstein hoax, what happens is you're not talking about how well we've done. [inaudible 00:17:00] And that's the whole purpose behind them. They want to waste people's time and some of the dumber Republicans like that.

Speaker 7 ( 17:08 ):

Mr. President on that subject, are we going to see-

Speaker 4 ( 17:10 ):

It mostly Democrats.

Speaker 7 ( 17:12 ):

Are we going to see more domestic travel from [inaudible 00:17:16], are we going to see some rallies?

Speaker 4 ( 17:17 ):

Domestic travel?

Speaker 7 ( 17:18 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 4 ( 17:19 ):

Well, I want to spend time here. I just got back from a big trip, a very successful trip with China and with all the countries. I saw many countries over there, but we stopped in Malaysia, Japan, South Korea. It was a phenomenal trip. We had a great meeting with President Xi, who's a great leader, great country actually. Whether you like it or not, China's a great country, amazing, amazing place. And Japan, amazing place. We stopped at tremendous countries with tremendous leaders and we did really well. We brought back trillions of dollars in trade and other things.

Speaker 7 ( 17:57 ):

Bur someone like Marjorie Taylor Green would say, you're spending too much time overseas, you're not spending enough time solving your domestic [inaudible 00:18:03].

Speaker 4 ( 18:03 ):

So I heard that Marjorie Taylor Greene said, "Oh gee, I'm spending too much time overseas." So let's say I don't meet with China. You know what's happening right now to Georgia, to every other state? They're not working because your magnets and your rare earths would've kicked in and there wouldn't be a factory in the world that was working. If I didn't have a relationship overseas with China, with Japan, with South Korea, with all of them, Malaysia, I went to Malaysia, but visited many more countries than that, if we didn't do that, if we just stayed right here, you would right now have no factory anywhere in the world that would be working because of rare earth with China.

( 18:42 ) Not only that, we made a deal with China, we've taken billions and billions of dollars. We made a deal with Japan, we've taken billions of dollars. We made a deal with South Korea, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars. If I would stay home, none of that would be happening.

( 18:58 ) And by the way, I stay home 95%, 98% of the time. The last thing I want to do is travel 22 hours in an airplane, as nice as this plane is, so Marjorie Taylor Greene is not any way… She has a very different thinking than I have. Something happened to her over the last period of a month or two where she changed I think politically, I think that her constituents aren't going to be happy. Already, I have people calling me, they want to challenge her to a race in her district in Georgia, and that's too bad. She's lost a wonderful conservative reputation.

( 19:37 ) But when she says, "Don't go overseas," if I didn't go overseas, we might be in a war right now with China.

Speaker 13 ( 19:44 ):

On nuclear testing, sir, on nuclear testing, sir, are you receiving any meetings about concerns about-

Speaker 4 ( 19:50 ):

We're going to have nuclear testing because other people test. We have other countries that test. We have more nuclear weapons than any other country. I'm the one that renovated them and built some, and I hated to do it, but I had no choice because they have it. We have more, Russia's second, and China is a distant third, but within four or five years they're going to be up with us. What I would like to do is I would like to go denuclearization, in other words, where we have a meeting primarily of the top three to cut back on nuclear weapons, that would be a great thing.

Speaker 13 ( 20:23 ):

How soon can the test take place though?

Speaker 4 ( 20:25 ):

Pretty soon. [inaudible 00:20:29]. We're number one, Russia is number two, China's number three, they're catching up. They're quite a bit distant from us right now, but they'll catch us in four or five years.

Speaker 1 ( 20:38 ):

Mr. president, can you tell us-

Speaker 4 ( 20:40 ):

I think the best thing would be that we denuclearize.

Speaker 1 ( 20:44 ):

Mr. President, could you tell us why you needed to get an MRI? I understand that the results were good, but what was it for?

Speaker 4 ( 20:51 ):

Because it's part of my physical. Getting an MRI is very standard. What, you think I shouldn't have and other people got it?

Speaker 1 ( 20:56 ):

No, but typically an MRI-

Speaker 4 ( 20:57 ):

I had an MRI-

Speaker 1 ( 20:58 ):

Is for a specific part of your body-

Speaker 4 ( 20:59 ):

Here's where the story is. I had an MRI. The doctor said it was the best result he has ever seen as a doctor, that's it. But I had an MRI as part of my standard yearly or I think they do it every two years, but I have the physical every year and the result was outstanding.

Speaker 1 ( 21:20 ):

Was it your brain or your heart?

Speaker 4 ( 21:22 ):

I have no idea what they analyzed, but whatever they analyzed, they analyzed it well and they said that I had as good a result as they've ever seen. Now, the other thing I took is I took is an advanced, very advanced test on mental acuity because I think a president should have to do that, and as you probably heard, I aced it, I got a perfect score. I got the highest score, I got a perfect score, and the only reason I tell you that is it's one subject, unlike Biden and others that you can take off your plate.

Speaker 13 ( 21:58 ):

One question on nuclear testing, just being very specific, are you saying you want to explode a warhead?

Speaker 4 ( 22:04 ):

I don't want to tell you about that. But we will do nuclear testing like other countries do. We have more nuclear weapons than any other country and we have to test?

Speaker 13 ( 22:13 ):

Other countries are not exploding warheads.

Speaker 14 ( 22:13 ):

[inaudible 00:22:14] did in the last election, do you think you'll get on the road for the next election?

Speaker 4 ( 22:18 ):

Oh yeah, I'll be helping people. I'll be on the road helping people. It's very important, the midterms are very important and again, I think we should terminate the filibuster. Republicans should terminate the filibuster. The Democrats would do it immediately if they ever got power and without Manchin and Sinema, they would've done it the last.

Speaker 14 ( 22:36 ):

Would you be open to endorse that someone primaring Marjorie Taylor Green given her latest statements?

Speaker 4 ( 22:42 ):

Well, it depends on who runs against her. I'm no longer much of a fan because I disagree with her policy. When she said that going to foreign countries bringing back trillions of dollars is not important, do you think I want to go and be on an airplane for 20 hours? Some of you were with me, 22 hours to be exact travel and then get off and make a speech and get people to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in our country. I'd rather do it without having to go, but if you didn't go, you wouldn't be able to have that kind of result.

( 23:16 ) As an example, Malaysia, if you look at Thailand, I stopped a war in Thailand and Cambodia. If I didn't go to that region, I probably wouldn't have been able to stop that war, that war would've been very costly in terms of lives, but even costly in terms of us.

Speaker 1 ( 23:36 ):

Are you meeting with lawmakers from Indiana next week on-

Speaker 4 ( 23:39 ):

Not that I know, I might be, I don't know. I guess they're making a decision as to whether or not they want to gain for the Republican Party, one or two more. By the way, I will say this, I heard… One or two more seats. I heard that a big lawsuit will be taking place, is but will be taking place concerning the California hoax where they're trying to get five more seats, and California is one of the most dishonest elections ever. They send out tens of millions of ballots to people all over the place. Many of those people get two or three ballots and they come back. California's a disgrace on voting and they're doing something that is very illegal. So we are or will be suing California on the five seats.

Speaker 1 ( 24:28 ):

The Department of Justice will be?

Speaker 4 ( 24:29 ):

The Department of Justice, yes. Being headed by the Department of Justice.

Speaker 13 ( 24:32 ):

You're meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince next week. Tell us-

Speaker 4 ( 24:36 ):

For the meeting, we're honoring Saudi Arabia, the Crown Prince, yes.

Speaker 13 ( 24:40 ):

One of your goals for the meeting, you decide whether to sell F-35 fighter jets to the Saudi Arabia, are you going to do that?

Speaker 4 ( 24:46 ):

Yeah, well, they wanted by a lot of jets. We make the best jets, we make the best missiles, you saw that when we took out the nuclear capability of Iran. For 22 years, they wanted to do that. No president had the guts to do it. We did it and Iran is a different place. By the way, Iran wants to negotiate a deal too. Everybody wants to negotiate with us now. If we didn't have military strength, if we didn't rebuild our military in my first term and now we continue to do it, Biden dissipated it by giving a chunk to the Taliban, not a good idea. But you know what the good news is? It was a lot, but relatively very little.

Speaker 13 ( 25:27 ):

So yes to the Jets or you're not sure yet?

Speaker 4 ( 25:30 ):

I'm looking at that. They've asked me to look at it. They want to buy a lot of F-35s, but they want to buy actually more than that fighter jets, yeah.

Speaker 15 ( 25:37 ):

Will the Abrahamic War be a part of that conversation perhaps?

Speaker 4 ( 25:40 ):

The what?

Speaker 15 ( 25:41 ):

The Abrahamic Accords getting Saudi Arabia and the-

Speaker 4 ( 25:42 ):

The Abrahamic Accords will be part we're going to be discussing. I hope that Saudi Arabia will be going into the Abrahamic Accords fairly shortly. We've had tremendous interest in the Abrahamic Accords since we put Iran out of business. Okay. Thank you much, thank you everybody.

Speaker 15 ( 26:00 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. Good to see you, Sir, thank you.
