Aaron Katersky ( 00:45 ):

There’s no telling when the appeals court may rule, but if Trump is unable to post a bond, the attorney general could begin to take ownership of Trump’s properties. We’re not sure that means padlocks and stickers on the door, but she told us she is determined to make sure Trump pays.

Speaker 1 ( 00:59 ):

The case is one of four criminal indictments the former president faces. Yesterday, Trump lost his attempt to block testimony from his former fixer Michael Cohen and from adult film actress Stormy Daniels at his upcoming trial over alleged hush money payments to Daniels. Trump pleaded not guilty to falsifying business records to pay Daniels for her silence about his sexual encounter, an encounter that Trump denies.

Stormy Daniels ( 01:22 ):

I came out of a bathroom to find myself cornered. I don’t remember how I got on the bed.

Speaker 1 ( 01:30 ):

In a new documentary, Daniels says she was scared for her life when news of the alleged affair and hush money payment came to light.

Speaker 4 ( 01:36 ):

At one point you recorded a last will.

Stormy Daniels ( 01:40 ):

Yeah, I was completely sure that I was going to die.

Speaker 5 ( 01:43 ):

Stormy, with the recent indictment, is it dangerous to keep speaking out in public?

Stormy Daniels ( 01:47 ):

There’s that saying hiding in plain view. If I hide and cower away, it just feeds the bully. So it’s just going to make it worse. But the only name anyone’s ever called me that really upset me is a liar.

Perry Russom ( 01:59 ):

The judge in the hush money case has also rejected Trump’s attempt to exclude the infamous Access Hollywood tape from the trial where he described it grabbing women.
