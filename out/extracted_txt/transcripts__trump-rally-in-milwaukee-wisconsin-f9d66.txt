Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Congressman Scott Fitzgerald.

MUSIC ( 00:38 ):

Whatever it takes.

Congressman Scott Fitzgerald ( 01:14 ):

How about Tommy Thompson, what the heck? We got to get him back as governor, I think, don't we? It's great to be with you this evening. Certainly a lot of familiar faces that have been, how many people have been to multiple Trump rallies? Fantastic. 13. There you go. So over 240 years ago, Thomas Jefferson said, "The enormity of the time in which I live has forced me to commit myself to the boisterous ocean of political passion." You know what TJ was talking about? He was talking about this rally right here. People dedicated to making sure that we take back our country. The reason you're here, and the reason we need you to continue to reach out till Tuesday is because this crowd right here is the firewall. You're the firewall to make sure that Kamala Harris and the Democrats don't continue to ruin this country. And the way we build that firewall is by you being here this evening. And as other speakers have said, continue to reach out and make sure that everyone you know, everyone that cares about this country shows up and casts their ballot. Donald J. Trump certainly has put himself out there and made sure that he is the man for the moment. Now we need to stand and support him. So before I leave the stage, there's one thing I wanted to try that worked very well in 2016, and that's our little cheer. I say Trump, you say Vance. I say Trump, you say Vance. Trump.

AUDIENCE ( 04:11 ):

Vance.

Congressman Scott Fitzgerald ( 04:11 ):

Trump.

AUDIENCE ( 04:15 ):

Congressman Scott Fitzgerald ( 04:16 ):

( 04:19 ) 'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains.

( 04:19 ) Whatever it takes.

( 04:19 ) Yeah, take me to the top I'm ready for.

( 04:19 ) Whatever it takes.

( 04:19 ) 'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins.

( 04:19 ) I do what it takes.

ANNOUNCER ( 04:51 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Congressman Brian Steil.

MUSIC ( 05:02 ):

Ain't America beautiful.

( 05:03 ) This place that we call home.

( 05:20 ) Give us your tired, your poor.

( 05:20 ) Those yearning to be free forevermore.

( 05:20 ) Ain't America beautiful.

( 05:20 ) Ain't America beautiful.

Congressman Brian Steil ( 05:28 ):

Are you guys ready to elect President Donald Trump in four days?

AUDIENCE ( 05:34 ):

Yeah.

Congressman Brian Steil ( 05:34 ):

Are you guys ready to elect President Donald Trump in four days?

AUDIENCE ( 05:40 ):

Yeah.

Congressman Brian Steil ( 05:40 ):

Isn't it great to be at a Trump rally?

AUDIENCE ( 05:42 ):

Yeah.

Congressman Brian Steil ( 05:44 ):

Isn't it great to come to an event that starts with the prayer, the pledge, and the national anthem?

AUDIENCE ( 05:55 ):

Yeah.

Congressman Brian Steil ( 05:55 ):

As I was driving up Interstate 94 this way, I was reminded of four years ago when President Donald Trump came to Kenosha. After our Democratic governor Tony Evers failed to provide the resources that were needed for the community at Kenosha, you know who answered the call? Donald J. Trump. As I was entering the building, I saw a lot of first responders and a lot of law enforcement officers. And as you look around, you see a lot of law enforcement officers here. And I'm proud to say that we back the badge, that President Trump backs the badge, that Republicans back the badge. And we should give all of our law enforcement officers a big round of applause to say thank you for what you do to keep us and our community safe.

( 06:48 ) I got to ask you how many people have already voted? And how many people are going to vote on Tuesday? We need everybody to get out. So if you've already voted, pledge on your pledge to get those that haven't gotten out yet out to the polls this Tuesday. And if you haven't gotten out, if you haven't gotten out, make your plan to get out on the polls on Tuesday because there's too much at stake. And make sure that you vote from President Donald Trump all the way through the ballot to the very end. Because on our ballot in the state of Wisconsin, we have an opportunity to make sure that our elections are for US citizens only.

( 07:46 ) When I started working in election integrity, I was telling people that under current law in Washington DC, let me just explain how crazy this is. The Petri dish that the Democrats want to roll out nationally. Under current law in Washington DC in four days, a non-citizen, say someone who works at the Russian embassy holding a Russian passport. A Russian national can leave the Russian embassy, walk to a polling place in our nation's capitol and vote in municipal elections. But we have an opportunity on Tuesday to vote yes on our amendment to say that Wisconsin's elections and Americans elections are for US citizens only. Do you agree?

AUDIENCE ( 08:31 ):

Yeah.

Congressman Brian Steil ( 08:31 ):

This election is so important because so many families can't afford what they need. So many families can't afford what they need. To the young couple that wants to go from paying the rent to paying the mortgage. I tell you on Tuesday, help is on the way. To the family with kids who can't afford their grocery bill, on Tuesday help is on the way. To the seniors on fixed incomes who are struggling to get by under the Biden-Harris administration, on Tuesday help is on the way. For those of you from Racine to Kenosha to Janesville and Beloit and everywhere in between I'm asking for your vote on Tuesday.

( 09:14 ) And let me tell you, in Washington DC, Ron Johnson is a heck of a great senator. But every time he votes on our behalf, somebody else cancels out his vote. But on Tuesday, we can change that by electing Eric Hovde, the next United States Senator from the state of Wisconsin. And on Tuesday with all of our work, we can elect President Donald J. Trump. Are you ready to elect President Donald Trump on Tuesday? Let's get it done Wisconsin. God bless.

MUSIC ( 09:56 ):

ANNOUNCER ( 10:26 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage candidate for United States Senate Eric Hovde.

MUSIC ( 10:52 ):

I'm rolling thunder, pouring rain.

( 10:52 ) I'm coming on like a hurricane.

Eric Hovde ( 11:15 ):

What a wonderful night in Milwaukee. Nine months ago, my lovely wife and I made the decision to get into this race for the US Senate for the same reason you are all here tonight. And that is because we love our country. We have been blessed to live in the most wonderful country in human history and provided that wonderful constitution that gave us more civil liberties, prosperity, and freedoms than any people have ever realized in human history. Folks, what has happened over the last four years I don't sometimes recognize our wonderful country. I feel like I've woken up into a bad episode of the Twilight Zone where what is right is wrong and what is wrong is right.

( 12:28 ) They bankrupted our country causing the worst bout of inflation in 40 years. That's right. They've jeopardized our safety by defunding the police and opening our southern borders. They've made our world less safe by their incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan and they've divided our country. They're experts at it. They divide us by gender, by race, by socioeconomic class, by religion. And then they have the gall to call half of Americans deplorable or garbage. Folks, this election is so consequential. We've never had an election where the outcomes are so different. Let's talk about what President Trump and I want to do versus what Kamala Harris and Tammy Baldwin.

( 13:31 ) What's President Trump want to do? Make America great again. What do I want to do? Restore the American dream. What do Harris and Baldwin want to do? They told us, they want to change America. And man, they sure did. And it hasn't been for the better. What do President Trump and I want to do? Protect and preserve that beautiful constitution that gave us more civil liberties and our First Amendment and our Second Amendment. What does Kamala Harris and Tammy Baldwin want to do? They want to rip up our constitution. They want liberal courts to decide and make law. And by the way, we saw how they treated our First Amendment during COVID. If you didn't say what they wanted, big tech and big media shut them down at their behest.

( 14:42 ) And every time they get a chance to vote on our Second Amendment, they want to take our right to defend ourselves and bear arms. That's what they want to do. What do President Trump and I want to do? We want to promote our free market capitalist system that's made us the most wealthy country and people in humanity. That's what we want to do. What does Harris and Baldwin want to do? They want to pull us down that path of socialism where only the very people at the top do well and everybody else gets poor. That's what they want to do. What do President Trump and I want to do? We want to strengthen the family, the bedrock of human history. What does Harris and Baldwin want to do? Destruct our family. Redefine it. Heck, they can't even agree what a woman is and what a guy is. And lastly, what is President Trump and I? Business guys, builders where results matter. If you don't succeed, you fail. You got to pick yourself up and accomplish something. What is Harris and Baldwin? Career politicians. The only thing they've affected is the ability to lie.

( 16:25 ) So folks, let me ask you, the choices are clear. Are you ready to take our country back?

AUDIENCE ( 16:35 ):

Yeah.

Eric Hovde ( 16:43 ):

President Trump and I are the tips of the spears, but we can't do it without you. The left, they have the media, they have big tech, they got public employee unions on their side, but we have you. And with your help, with your help, not only you going out and voting, but grabbing your friends, grabbing your neighbors, grabbing your colleagues. Grabbing the people you go fishing or hunting with, or do social activities or watch Packer games with. If you go grab five, 10 of them, get them out and get them voting, we will take this country back. We will restore our beautiful country. So I ask you, are you ready to run all the way to November 5th? Are you ready to restore the American dream? Then let's go make America great again.

ANNOUNCER ( 18:22 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Senator Ron Johnson.

MUSIC ( 18:33 ):

Your time is up, my time is now.

( 18:33 ) You can't see me, my time is now.

( 18:33 ) Its the franchise, boy, I'm shining now.

( 18:33 ) You can't see me, my time is now.

( 18:33 ) In case you forgot, or fell off, I'm still hot, knock your shell off.

( 18:47 ) My money stack fat, plus I can't turn the swell off.

( 18:49 ) The franchise doing big business, I live this.

( 18:49 ) Is automatic I win this so you hear those horns who finish.

( 18:49 ) A soldier and I stay-

Senator Ron Johnson ( 18:56 ):

Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

AUDIENCE ( 19:35 ):

U-S-A.

( 19:36 ) U-S-A.

( 19:36 ) U-S-A.

( 19:36 ) U-S-A.

Senator Ron Johnson ( 19:40 ):

Wow. Thank you. And by the way, that's my main message here is thank you. Thank you for coming and showing your support for the next President of the United States Donald J. Trump. Thank you for understanding that he didn't have to do this. He had a great life. He didn't have to risk his life. He didn't have to give up that life. He did it because he like you, loves this country. He fervently loves this country. And by the way, he was 100% correct when he said, "You cannot lead America if you do not love Americans." I would add, and if you do not love America. A lot has been made of the garbage comment. By the way, wasn't that brilliant up in Green Bay? The garbage truck, the orange vest? I think it did make them look thinner, right?

( 20:54 ) But let's face it that calling you garbage is not a one-off. We've seen that time and time again. President Biden thought half of you, half America potential domestic terrorists. Hillary Clinton called you deplorable. Vice president Harris thinks you love Nazis and fascists. President Obama thinks you get bitter and cling to your guns and your religion. Is there something wrong with that? But that just shows you the disdain the Democrat leaders, and I'm talking about their leaders, have for half American. Quite honestly, I don't think they really respect their own voters. Because they sure don't enact policies that help the lower income individuals that they purport to represent. Not at all. But again, that just proves that they don't love Americans.

( 22:01 ) But as President Obama, if you remember this five days before he got elected, he said, "In five days, we're going to fundamentally transform America." Now I have to ask, do you even much less love something you want to fundamentally transform? The analogy I use is I wake up in the morning, I look at Jane and say, "Jane, I love you. Now I'm going to change everything about you. You need a little fundamental transformation." That wouldn't go over very well.

( 22:31 ) But what we're finding is now as that indicate that they don't particularly like this country if they want to fundamentally change it. What we're finding out is their fundamental change, their fundamental transformation is they're fundamentally destroying America. Which is the other thing I want to thank you for coming here and understanding our nation is in peril because of Democratic governance. Their open borders, they're 40-year high inflation. You're spending $1,000 more a month just to live than you had to spend at the start of the Biden administration. There weren't fossil fuels. All these policies of theirs, all their ideology is weakening America and emboldening our enemies, which has set the world on fire. Have you had enough of it?

AUDIENCE ( 23:23 ):

Yeah.

Senator Ron Johnson ( 23:23 ):

Are you ready to fix it?

AUDIENCE ( 23:24 ):

Yeah.

Senator Ron Johnson ( 23:24 ):

Well, the good news is we can elect President Trump who has a record of fixing things. He has the policies and we know he does because he enacted them before. Lower taxes, less regulations, no more wars. And what President Trump does not get enough credit for is the complete realignment of our politics. Have you noticed now that Democrats are the party of the elite? They're the ones that have all the billionaires. President Trump has made the Republican Party the party of the working men and women of America that make this country great.

( 24:21 ) He's also assembled a group of leaders from across the political spectrum. Bobby Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard, Elon Musk and last Wednesday, Brett Favre. By the way, if you weren't able to watch Brett's endorsement speech, go on YouTube and watch it. It was tremendous. It was so heartfelt. It was so genuine. Brett has never done anything political. It's pretty dangerous for somebody like him and his position do so. But he's so concerned about what is happening in this country like you are. He's so concerned about his children and his grandchildren he had to speak up and God bless him for doing it.

( 25:23 ) So again, I don't know what Brett's prior politics were. I know what Bobby Kennedy's and Tulsi Gabbard's were. Again, I don't necessarily agree with everything that they believe in. They don't agree with everything that we believe in. But this is what we have all in common. Is these are individuals that love this country like we do, like President Trump does. They're smart people. They're very smart people. They also recognize that it is the Democrat party and Democrat leaders that are the threat to our democracy. Not us, them. And I give President Trump and Bobby Kennedy so much credit for laying their differences aside and focusing on an aired agreement. In this case, chronic illness, a major problem we have to deal with. But in doing that, in solving that problem together, they are demonstrating to all of us how you set your differences aside, focus on airs agreement. That is how you heal and unify a very divided nation.

( 26:35 ) I was at an event on Tuesday with Bobby Kennedy and Tulsi Gabbard, probably about a thousand people in Madison. And Tulsi got up and she just asked the crowd, "Now how many of you are either Democrats or former Democrats?" About half the audience raise her hand. I was so grateful to see that. Because I truly believe, whether you're Independent, Democrat or Republican, I think most Americans understand how rare and precious this thing that we call America is. They understand that it is our solemn duty to preserve it for future generations. And they're willing to join this new coalition that President Trump is trying to assemble. If the mainstream media would only allow him to do so. But assembling this coalition of people who love this country, who had the capability of fixing it. And of course, who else is going to fix it other than men and women who actually work. That's what we've got going for us.

( 27:52 ) So my appeal to anybody listening to this, I don't care whether you're a Republican, Independent, Democrat, Libertarian, I don't care. What's your political affiliation. If you love this country, if you realize it is in peril, that we have major challenges and you realize that the only or the best way of addressing those problems, fixing this nation is if we do it as a unified United States of America. Please, please join us. Please join us and make America great again. God bless all of you. God bless President Trump and God bless America.

( 42:16 ) You, my brown-eyed girl.

( 42:16 ) Do you remember when we used to sing?

( 42:16 ) Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da.

( 42:16 ) Just like that.

( 42:16 ) Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da, la-tee-da.

( 42:16 ) So hard to find my way.

( 42:16 ) Now that I'm all on my own.

( 42:16 ) I saw you just the other day.

( 42:16 ) My, how you have grown.

( 43:16 ) Cast my memory back there, Lord.

( 43:17 ) Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout it.

( 43:17 ) Making love in the green grass.

( 43:17 ) Behind the stadium with you.

( 43:17 ) My brown-eyed girl.

( 43:17 ) You, my brown-eyed girl.

( 43:17 ) Do you remember when we used to sing?

( 43:17 ) Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da.

( 43:17 ) Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da.

( 43:17 ) Oh, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Late December back in 63.

( 43:17 ) What a very special time for me.

( 43:17 ) As I remember, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Oh, what a night, you know I didn't even know her name.

( 43:17 ) But I was never gonna be the same.

( 43:17 ) What a lady, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Oh, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room.

( 43:17 ) And my, as I recall it ended much too soon.

( 43:17 ) Oh, what a night, hypnotizin', mesmerizing me.

( 43:17 ) She was everything I dreamed she'd be.

( 43:17 ) Sweet surrender, what a night.

( 43:17 ) I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder.

( 43:17 ) Spinnin' my head around and takin' my body under

( 43:17 ) Oh, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Oh, I got a funny feelin' when she walked in the room.

( 43:17 ) And my, as I recall it ended much too soon.

( 43:17 ) Oh, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Why'd it take so long to see the light?

( 43:17 ) Seemed so wrong, but now it seems so right.

( 43:17 ) What a lady, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Oh, I felt a rush like a rollin' ball of thunder.

( 43:17 ) Spinnin' my head around and takin' my body under.

( 43:17 ) Oh, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Do-do-do, do-do-do.

( 43:17 ) Do-do-do-do, oh, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Do-do-do, do-do-do.

( 43:17 ) Do-do-do-do-do-do, oh, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Do-do-do, do-do-do.

( 43:17 ) Do-do-do-do-do-do, oh, what a night.

( 43:17 ) Don't you feel it growing, day by day.

( 43:17 ) People getting ready for the news.

( 43:17 ) Some are happy, some are sad.

( 43:17 ) Oh, we got to let the music play.

( 43:17 ) What the people need.

( 43:17 ) Is a way to make 'em smile.

( 43:18 ) It ain't so hard to do if you know how.

( 43:18 ) Gotta get a message.

( 43:18 ) Get it on through.

( 43:26 ) Oh now mama, don't you ask me why.

( 43:26 ) And we'll dance. Oh, we're gonna dance our blues away.

( 43:43 ) And if I'm feeling good to you.

( 43:43 ) And you're feeling good to me.

( 43:43 ) There ain't nothing we can't do or say.

( 43:43 ) Feeling good, feeling fine.

( 43:43 ) Oh, baby, let the music play.

( 43:43 ) Whoa, listen to the music.

( 43:43 ) Whoa, listen to the music.

( 43:43 ) Whoa, listen to the music.

( 43:43 ) All the time.

( 43:43 ) Like a lazy flowing river.

( 43:43 ) Surrounding castles in the sky.

( 43:43 ) And the crowd is growing bigger.

( 43:43 ) Listening for the happy sounds.

( 43:43 ) And I got to let them fly.

( 43:43 ) Whoa, listen to the music.

( 43:43 ) So many things that I want to say.

( 43:43 ) You know I like my girls a little bit older.

( 43:43 ) I just wanna use your love tonight.

( 43:43 ) I don't wanna lose your love tonight.

( 43:43 ) I ain't got many friends left to talk to.

( 43:43 ) No one's around when I'm in trouble.

( 43:43 ) You know I'd do anything for you.

( 43:43 ) Stay the night but keep it undercover.

( 43:43 ) I just wanna use your love tonight.

( 43:43 ) I don't wanna lose your love tonight.

( 43:43 ) Try to stop my hands from shakin'.

( 43:43 ) Somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense.

( 43:43 ) It's been awhile since we were all alone.

( 43:47 ) I can't hide the way I'm feelin'.

( 43:47 ) As you leave me, please, would you close the door?

( 43:47 ) And don't forget what I told you.

( 43:47 ) Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong.

( 43:47 ) Another shoulder to cry upon.

( 43:47 ) I just wanna use your love tonight, yeah.

( 56:25 ) And this is for the questions that don't have any answers.

( 56:25 ) The midnight glancers and the topless dancers.

( 56:25 ) The gander freaks, cars packed with speakers.

( 56:25 ) The Gs with the 40's and the chicks with beepers.

( 56:25 ) The Northern Lights and the Southern Comfort.

( 56:25 ) And it don't even matter if their veins are punctured.

( 56:25 ) All the crackheads, the critics, the cynics.

( 56:25 ) All you bastards at the IRS.

( 56:25 ) For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks.

( 56:25 ) For the shots of Jack and the caps of Meth.

( 56:25 ) Half pints of love and the 5th's of stress.

( 56:25 ) For the hookers all trickin' out in Hollywood.

( 56:25 ) And for my hoods of the world misunderstood.

( 56:25 ) I said, "It's all good, and it's all in fun".

( 56:25 ) All the gangs gettin' money in the heads they bang-bang.

( 56:25 ) Wild mustangs, the porno flicks.

( 56:25 ) All my homies in the county in Cell Block 6.

( 57:18 ) The grits where there ain't enough eggs to cook.

( 57:18 ) And for D.B. Cooper and the money he took.

( 57:18 ) You can look for answers, but that ain't fun.

( 57:18 ) Now get in the pit and try to love someone.

( 57:18 ) Bawitdaba, da-bang, da-bang, diggy-diggy-diggy.

( 57:18 ) Said the boogie, said up drop the boogie.

( 57:18 ) I hopped off the plane at LAX.

( 57:18 ) With a dream and my cardigan.

( 57:18 ) Welcome to the land of fame excess.

( 57:18 ) Whoa.

( 57:18 ) Am I gonna fit in?

( 57:18 ) Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time.

( 57:18 ) Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign.

( 57:18 ) This is all so crazy.

( 57:18 ) Everybody seems so famous.

( 59:13 ) My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick.

( 59:21 ) Too much pressure and I'm nervous.

( 59:24 ) That's when the taxi man turned on the radio.

( 59:25 ) And a Jay-Z song was on.

( 59:25 ) And a Jay-Z song was on.

( 59:25 ) And a Jay-Z song was on.

( 01:00:04 ) Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?

( 01:00:07 ) She gotta be from out of town"

( 01:00:10 ) So hard with my girls not around me.

( 01:00:11 ) It's definitely not a Nashville party.

( 01:00:16 ) 'Cause all I see are stilettos.

( 01:00:16 ) I guess I never got the memo.

( 01:00:16 ) My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick.

( 01:00:16 ) Too much pressure and I'm nervous.

( 01:00:24 ) That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune.

( 01:00:25 ) And a Britney song was on.

( 01:00:25 ) And a Britney song was on.

( 01:05:55 ) But-

MUSIC ( 01:06:00 ):

I can't begin to know when.

( 01:06:01 ) But then I know it's growing strong.

( 01:06:11 ) Was in the spring.

( 01:06:15 ) And spring became the summer.

( 01:06:19 ) Who'd have believed you'd come along?

( 01:06:20 ) Hands.

( 01:06:29 ) Touching hands.

( 01:06:33 ) Reaching out.

( 01:06:37 ) Touching me, touching you.

( 01:07:08 ) Sweet Caroline.

Audience ( 01:07:08 ):

(singing)

MUSIC ( 01:07:08 ):

Good times never seemed so good.

( 01:07:08 ) I've been inclined.

Audience ( 01:07:08 ):

(singing)

MUSIC ( 01:07:12 ):

To believe they never would.

( 01:07:12 ) But now I look at the night.

( 01:07:15 ) We fill it up with only two.

( 01:07:23 ) And when I hurt.

( 01:07:28 ) How can I hurt when holding you? Warm.

( 01:07:42 ) Touching warm.

( 01:07:46 ) Reaching out.

( 01:07:46 ) Touching me, touching you.

MUSIC ( 01:10:12 ):

Just take those old records off the shelf.

( 01:10:12 ) I'll sit and listen to them by myself.

( 01:10:12 ) Today's music ain't got the same soul.

( 01:10:12 ) I like that old time rock and roll.

( 01:10:12 ) Don't try to take me to a disco.

( 01:10:12 ) You'll never even get me out on the floor.

( 01:10:12 ) In 10 minutes I'll be late for the door.

( 01:10:12 ) I like that old time rock and roll.

( 01:10:12 ) Still like that old time rock and roll.

( 01:10:12 ) That kind of music just soothes the soul.

( 01:10:12 ) I reminisce about the days of old.

( 01:10:12 ) With that old time rock and roll.

( 01:10:12 ) Oh.

( 01:10:12 ) Won't go to hear them play a tango.

( 01:10:12 ) I'd rather hear some blues or funky old soul.

( 01:10:15 ) There's only one sure way to get me to go.

( 01:10:19 ) Start playing old time rock and roll.

( 01:10:24 ) Call me a relic, call me what you will.

( 01:10:25 ) Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill.

( 01:10:29 ) Today's music ain't got the same soul.

( 01:10:29 ) I like that old time rock and roll.

( 01:10:29 ) We've been together since way back when.

( 01:10:29 ) Sometimes I never wanna see you again.

( 01:10:29 ) But I want you to know, after all these years.

( 01:10:29 ) You're still the one I want whispering in my ear.

( 01:10:29 ) You're still the one I wanna talk to in bed.

( 01:10:29 ) Still the one that turns my head.

( 01:10:29 ) We're still having fun and you're still the one.

( 01:10:29 ) I looked at your face every day.

( 01:10:29 ) But I never saw it til I went away.

( 01:10:29 ) When winter came, I just wanted to go.

( 01:10:29 ) Wanted to go.

( 01:10:29 ) Deep in the desert, I longed for the snow.

( 01:10:29 ) You're still the one that makes me laugh.

( 01:10:29 ) Still the one and I can't get enough.

( 01:10:29 ) We're still having fun and you're still the one.

( 01:10:29 ) You're still the one who can scratch my itch.

( 01:10:29 ) You're still the one that I wouldn't switch.

( 01:10:29 ) We're still having fun and you're still the one.

( 01:10:29 ) You are still the one that makes me shout.

( 01:10:29 ) Still the one that I dream about.

( 01:10:29 ) We're still having fun and you're still the one.

( 01:10:29 ) You are still the one.

( 01:22:59 ) It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long.

( 01:28:11 ) Caught somewhere between a boy and man.

( 01:28:15 ) She was 17 and she was far from in between.

( 01:28:20 ) It was summertime in northern Michigan. Splashing through the sandbar.

( 01:28:37 ) Talking by the campfire.

( 01:28:38 ) It's the simple things in life like when and where.

( 01:28:43 ) We didn't have no internet.

( 01:28:46 ) But man, I never will forget.

( 01:28:48 ) The way the moonlight shined upon her hair.

( 01:28:52 ) And we were trying different things.

( 01:28:53 ) And we were smoking funny things.

( 01:28:57 ) Making love out by the lake to our favorite song.

( 01:29:02 ) Sipping whiskey out the bottle.

( 01:29:04 ) Not thinking 'bout tomorrow.

( 01:29:06 ) Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long.

( 01:29:06 ) Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long.

( 01:29:21 ) Catching walleye from the dock.

( 01:29:22 ) Watching the waves roll off the rocks.

( 01:29:23 ) She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul. We'd blister in the sun.

( 01:29:32 ) We couldn't wait for night to come.

( 01:29:33 ) To hit that sand and play some rock and roll.

( 01:29:33 ) While we were trying different things.

( 01:29:33 ) And we were smoking funny things.

( 01:29:33 ) Making love out by the lake to our favorite song.

( 01:29:33 ) To our favorite song.

( 01:29:33 ) Singing Sweet Home Alabama all summer long.

( 01:29:33 ) Sweet Home Alabama, oh, yeah. Now nothing seems as strange as when the leaves began to change.

( 01:31:01 ) Or how we thought those days would never end.

( 01:31:05 ) Sometimes I hear that song and I start to sing along.

( 01:31:10 ) And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again.

( 01:31:12 ) Man, I'd like to see that girl again.

( 01:31:12 ) And we were trying different things.

( 01:31:12 ) Trying different things, yeah.

( 01:31:12 ) And we were smoking funny things.

( 01:31:12 ) Making love out by the lake to our favorite song.

( 01:31:53 ) We were trying different things.

( 01:31:53 ) And we were smoking funny things.

( 01:31:53 ) Smoking funny things.

( 01:31:53 ) Making love down by the lake to our favorite song.

( 01:31:53 ) Sipping whiskey out the bottle.

( 01:31:53 ) Oh, yeah.

( 01:31:53 ) Not thinking 'bout tomorrow.

( 01:31:53 ) Oh, yeah.

( 01:32:05 ) Singing 'bout Sweet Home Alabama, yeah.

( 01:32:05 ) Singing all summer long.

( 01:32:07 ) Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen.

( 01:32:50 ) Pour myself a cup of ambition.

( 01:32:52 ) And yawn and stretch and try to come to life.

( 01:32:57 ) Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping. Out on the street the traffic starts jumping.

( 01:33:02 ) The folks like me on the job from nine to five.

( 01:33:03 ) Working nine to five, what a way to make a living.

( 01:33:03 ) Barely getting by it's all taking and no giving.

( 01:33:03 ) They just use your mind and they never give you credit.

( 01:33:03 ) It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it.

( 01:33:03 ) Nine to five, for service and devotion.

( 01:33:03 ) You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion.

( 01:33:03 ) Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me.

( 01:33:38 ) I swear sometimes that man is out to get me.

( 01:33:49 ) They let you dream just to watch them shatter.

( 01:33:50 ) You're just a step on the boss man's ladder.

( 01:33:52 ) But you got dreams he'll never take away.

( 01:33:54 ) You're in the same boat with a lotta your friends. Waiting for the day your ship will come in.

( 01:34:01 ) Then the tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way.

( 01:34:04 ) Working nine to five what a way to make a living.

( 01:34:04 ) Barely getting by it's all taking and no giving.

( 01:34:04 ) They just use your mind and you never get the credit.

( 01:34:04 ) It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it.

( 02:02:09 ) Waitin' on you to look my way and scoot.

( 02:02:16 ) All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you downtown.

( 02:02:20 ) But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out.

( 02:02:20 ) Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat.

( 02:02:20 ) Floatin' down the Flint River.

( 02:02:34 ) Catch us up a little catfish dinner.

( 02:02:36 ) Gonna sound like a winner.

( 02:02:38 ) When I lay you down and love you right.

( 02:02:41 ) Yeah, that's my kind of night.

( 02:02:42 ) Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate.

( 02:02:59 ) Little Conway, a little T-Pain.

( 02:03:01 ) Might just make it rain.

( 02:03:04 ) You can hang your T-shirt on a limb.

( 02:03:09 ) Oh, time to get our buzz on.

( 02:03:09 ) All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you downtown.

( 02:03:09 ) Yeah, that's my kind of night.

( 02:03:09 ) Yeah, that's my kind of night.

( 02:03:09 ) Come on. American girls and American guys.

( 02:04:54 ) We'll always stand up and salute.

( 02:04:57 ) We'll always recognize. When we see Old Glory flying.

( 02:05:03 ) There's a lot of men dead.

( 02:05:05 ) So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head.

( 02:05:12 ) My daddy served in the army.

( 02:05:14 ) Where he lost his right eye but he flew a flag out in our yard.

( 02:05:21 ) 'Til the day that he died.

( 02:05:21 ) He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me.

( 02:05:26 ) To grow up and live happy in the land of the free.

( 02:05:31 ) Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack.

( 02:05:35 ) A mighty sucker punch came flyin' in from somewhere in the back.

( 02:05:40 ) Soon as we could see clearly.

( 02:05:42 ) Through our big black eye.

( 02:05:45 ) Man, we lit up your world.

( 02:05:47 ) Like the fourth of July.

( 02:05:47 ) Hey Uncle Sam, put your name at the top of his list.

( 02:05:47 ) And the Statue of Liberty started shakin' her fist.

( 02:05:58 ) And the eagle will fly.

( 02:05:58 ) Man, it's gonna be hell.

( 02:05:58 ) When you hear mother freedom start ringin' her bell. And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you.

( 02:06:13 ) Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue.

( 02:06:21 ) Oh, and justice will be served and the battle will rage. This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage.

( 02:06:50 ) And you'll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A. 'Cause we'll put a boot in your ass.

( 02:07:01 ) It's the American way.

( 02:07:01 ) Hey Uncle Sam, put your name at the top of his list.

( 02:07:09 ) And the Statue of Liberty started shakin' her fist.

( 02:07:13 ) And the eagle will fly and it's gonna be hell.

( 02:07:18 ) When you hear mother freedom start ringin' her bell.

( 02:07:22 ) And it'll feel like the whole wide world is raining down on you.

( 02:07:24 ) Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue.

( 02:07:24 ) Oh-oh, of the red, white, and blue.

( 02:07:24 ) Oh-oh, of my red, white, and blue.

( 02:07:24 ) I've been tryna call.

( 02:07:24 ) I've been on my own for long enough.

( 02:07:24 ) Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe.

( 02:08:36 ) I'm going through withdrawals.

( 02:08:39 ) You don't even have to do too much.

( 02:08:40 ) You can turn me on with just a touch, baby.

( 02:11:24 ) I look around and Sin City's cold and empty.

( 02:11:24 ) No one's around to judge me.

( 02:11:24 ) I can't see clearly when you're gone.

( 02:11:24 ) I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights.

( 02:11:24 ) No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch.

( 02:11:24 ) I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night.

( 02:11:24 ) Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust.

( 02:11:24 ) Hey, hey, hey.

( 02:11:24 ) I'm running out of time. 'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky.

( 02:11:50 ) So I hit the road in overdrive, baby.

( 02:11:50 ) The city's cold and empty.

( 02:11:50 ) No one's around to judge me.

( 02:11:50 ) I can't see clearly when you're gone.

( 02:11:50 ) I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights.

( 02:11:50 ) No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch.

( 02:11:50 ) I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night.

( 02:11:50 ) Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust.

( 02:11:50 ) I'm just walking by to let you know by.

( 02:11:50 ) I can never say it on the phone.

( 02:11:50 ) Will never let you go this time.

( 02:11:50 ) I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights.

( 02:11:50 ) No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch.

( 02:11:50 ) Hey, hey, hey.

( 02:11:50 ) Hey, hey, hey.

( 02:11:50 ) I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights.

( 02:11:50 ) Come on.

( 02:11:50 ) Ma-ma-ma-ma, yeah, whoo.

( 02:11:50 ) I never knew how complete love could be.

( 02:11:54 ) 'Til she kissed me and said.

( 02:11:54 ) "Baby, please go all the way.

( 02:11:54 ) It feels so right.

( 02:11:54 ) Feels so right.

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Senator Mark Wayne Mullen.

Speaker 3 ( 02:19:54 ):

Sun coming up over New York City. School bus driver in a traffic jam.

Mark Wayne Mullen ( 02:20:06 ):

How's it going, everybody? Right off the bat, I want to all of our service members and our veterans, will you raise your hand for me? Let me tell you thank you because I want you guys to look around. We're here because of the sacrifice you made. Thank you so much. You guys fought for this country. You gave us a right to do this. And I want to talk about another fighter we have that's fighting for this country, right? You and I are here because we're fed up where America's headed right now. The Harris-Biden administration has failed America.

( 02:21:17 ) And we need a fighter. We need one that knows how to fight back against an overbearing government. We need a fighter by the name of Donald J. Trump. We need a fighter that knows how to win a fight. And man, we know he knows how to win a fight. President Trump is not only going to fight against the bureaucrats in Washington DC, but he's also going to fight to bring down inflation. He's going to fight to bring back energy independence. Drill, baby drill. He's going to fight to actually get our economy back on track and he's going to fight to secure our borders.

( 02:22:21 ) Now, I know a little bit about fighting, and I know a fighter when I see one. And the man I'm talking about tonight showed great courage during an assassination attempt. The man stood up, he raised his fist in the air, and for all Americans, he said, "Fight, fight, fight." That's the guy we need to get this country back on track. This is a man I call my friend. And this is a man that's soon to be the 47th President of the United States of America. So in closing, I want to say may God bless you guys, may God bless President Trump, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you all.

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage United States Senator Eric Schmidt.

Speaker 8 ( 02:24:11 ):

Thunderstruck. Thunderstruck. Yeah, yeah, yeah, thunderstruck. Ooh, thunderstruck. Yeah.

Eric Schmidt ( 02:24:15 ):

All right. You guys ready to save America? Look at all the joy in here. There's a lot of joy in here. I don't see it on the other side. I'm also told that, we heard on the plane ride in that Kamala last night dressed up as a moderate. It did not go well. No one's buying it. No one is buying this. Fake Kamala's got a lot of problems and you can't even handle the softball questions. You guys all saw the interview on The View. After they have absolutely destroyed all the successes that we had under President Trump, all of them, she was asked, "What would you do differently than Joe Biden over the last four years?" And she said, "Nothing comes to mind." Well, that makes a lot of sense. Under President Trump, we had a 45-year low in illegal immigration. We had a booming economy. The great working people of this state and across the country were able to buy more. They could afford a house, they could afford a car. All that's gone. The sticker shock every week at the grocery store is a testament to their failed policies. Every single thing that they've done has been a total disaster. But here's the good news. We're just a few days away from electing President Donald J. Trump. And before I had this job, I had a different job. I was the Attorney General in Missouri. That's right. And we took those vaccine mandates all the way to the Supreme Court and we won. We took that student loan debt, forgiveness scam to the Supreme Court and we won. We took on big tech and exposed censorship in Missouri versus Biden. And let me tell you, I know a little something about fighting back, but I've never seen anybody as tough and willing to fight than President Trump. What we saw on that stage in Pennsylvania, when he came within a millimeter of losing his life, his first reaction was to do what? Stand up and say, "Fight, fight, fight." So we can honor that. We can honor that courage with courage of our own. There's a reason. There's a reason why they call us garbage. There's a reason why they call us deplorables. There's a reason why they try to censor us. It's to silence us. It's to intimidate us. It's to try to get us to not come out and know that we have the right vision for America, but we know that we do. So here's what we need to do. On Tuesday, if you haven't done it already, vote. Get out and vote. Because all the polls, they're great. These rallies are great. They're important. But the most important poll is going to be on Tuesday. So when you listen to all these great speeches, and President Trump's got a humdinger coming for you, text 10 friends. Make sure somebody gets to the polls. Because if we all do that, if we all fight back on Tuesday, we're going to make sure that President Trump is the 47th President of the United States. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Let's go. Let's go.

Speaker 4 ( 02:28:42 ):

Oh, oh, oh. I've got lightning inside me, son of a gun. I'm a like a titan that's rising. Oh, just you watch. I'm stepping into fate. There is no time to waste. I've got that lightning inside-

USA. USA.

Crowd ( 02:28:43 ):

USA. USA. USA.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. ( 02:29:15 ):

Thank you very much. I started my presidential campaign 19 months ago and the Democrats fought. They canceled the primaries so I couldn't run, and they canceled the debates and then I switched to independent and I was taking more votes away from Donald Trump than the Democrats. But Donald Trump never sued me and he never said anything nasty about me. He was always very civil. The Democrats sued me and they sued me to keep me off the ballot. They spent $10 million. They filed suits in 10 states. And then when I endorsed President Trump in August, they sued me to keep me on the ballot. And they lost most of those suits. Yes, two days ago they won two of them in Wisconsin and in Michigan.

Crowd ( 02:30:33 ):

Boo.

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. ( 02:30:35 ):

And why do they do that? They did that because they want to confuse the voters. They want to interfere with the election because they're keeping somebody on the ballot who's not running. So when you go to the voting booth on Tuesday, you're going to see my name on the ballot. I do not want your vote. I want you to vote for Donald Trump.

Crowd ( 02:31:01 ):

[inaudible 02:31:02].

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. ( 02:31:01 ):

[inaudible 02:31:02]. The only way I'm going to go to Washington is if we get Donald Trump elected, and that's the only way we're going to fix this catastrophe that is impacting our children. This chronic disease epidemic. When I was a ten-year-old boy, my uncle was President of the United States and 6% of Americans had chronic disease. Today, 60% do. When my uncle was president, we spent zero on chronic disease in this country. There wasn't even medications for any chronic diseases. Today we spent $4.3 trillion every year. It's five times our military budget. It is bankrupting our country. It is hurting our national security. 77% of American children cannot qualify for military service because of a chronic disease diagnosis. When my uncle was president, 3% of Americans were obese. Today, 50% of our children are obese. And this isn't true in other countries. In other countries it's the same as it was then. In Japan, 3% of the people are obese. It's impacting our country because we're mass poisoning ourselves and we're poisoning our children.

( 02:32:54 ) There's a thousand ingredients in our food that are illegal in Europe, and the problem is not those ingredients. The problem is the corruption in Washington DC, the capture of our agencies. And the only president who's going to clean that up is Donald J. Trump. We have the sickest children in the world. When I was a kid, the autism rates… And today in my generation, seventy-year-old men, one in 10,000 of us has autism. In my children's generation, it's one in every 34 children. One in every 24 in California. When I was a kid, juvenile diabetes was unknown. The typical pediatrician would see one case of diabetes in his entire career, a 40- or 50-year career. Today, one out of every three children who walks through his office door is diabetic or pre-diabetic. We are killing our kids. 40% of our kids are on antidepressants. The sperm counts have dropped 50%.

( 02:34:14 ) Testosterone levels have dropped 50%. American girls are reaching puberty at 10 to 13 years old, six years younger than they were a generation ago. We are destroying these children. I had 11 brothers and sisters. I had 17 first cousins. I never knew anybody with a peanut allergy. Why do five of my kids have peanut allergies? Why do all of our kids have eczema and asthma and allergies? This is not normal. I know what a normal child looks like. And our kids today are injured and they're damaged. And they're damaged because we're being poisoned. And that comes from corruption. I started working on this issue 19 years ago. And for 19 years, I have got, every morning without one exception, I have set a prayer to God to put me in a position where I could end the chronic disease epidemic. And on August 23rd of this year, God sent me Donald J. Trump. And Donald Trump said to me in Milwaukee… We met for two and a half hours. And he said, "I want you to join my campaign and unify our efforts. And I'm going to end the foreign wars, the addiction to war. The $200 billion that we sent to Ukraine, we're going to spend it here in the United States."

( 02:36:21 ) And he told me, "We're going to end the censorship. We're going to end the surveillance. We're going to end the weaponization of our enforcement agencies against the American people." And he knew that my uncle, Ted Kennedy, wrote Title IX to make sure that women's sports are protected in schools. And he said, "We're going to end the efforts of the Democratic Party, the war that they're making on women's sports in schools." And he said, "We're going to end the chronic disease epidemic and we are going to make America healthy again." Don't you want a president who's going to get the toxins out of our food? Don't you want a president who's going to end the corruption in Washington, DC? And don't you want a president who's going to end all the foreign wars that are sucking away our money and our… Don't you want a president who's going to end the censorship, end the surveillance, and protect the Constitution of the United States? And don't you want a president who's going to make this a free country again, where we treasure our liberties? A president who's going to make America healthy again? A president who's going to make America great again? And let's go to the polls on Tuesday and deliver a landslide for Donald J. Trump. Thank you all.

Speaker 4 ( 02:41:06 ):

I've got lightning inside me, son of a God. I'm like a titan that's rising. Oh, just you watch. I'm stepping into fate. There is no time to-

Speaker 5 ( 02:41:28 ):

When I first came into office, I cut taxes more than any other President. We have created seven million new jobs and it led to a growth like we've never seen before. We developed the greatest economy in history by far. When I left office, it changed. Inflation destroyed the lives of so many people. Interest rates went from 2% to 10%. Millions of illegal immigrants, traffickers and drugs coming into our country. Our country has gone to hell. So I made a decision to run. We're going to make America great again. Greater than ever before. I will fight for you with every breath, and I will never let you down.

Speaker 9 ( 02:42:19 ):

I'm going to fight like a G. They all going to see. And if I die, I'm going to die free.

Speaker 11 ( 02:42:25 ):

President Trump is literally putting his life on the line and he's willing to risk it all because he loves this country.

Speaker 9 ( 02:42:32 ):

He is strong, he is fearless, and he is what this country needs right now.

Speaker 10 ( 02:42:39 ):

Our cities will be safe. Our streets will be clean, and our border will be secure.

Speaker 9 ( 02:42:45 ):

I don't ever quit.

Speaker 12 ( 02:42:46 ):

We can't allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people, our freedom and our future.

Speaker 13 ( 02:42:55 ):

The left told me to hate Trump. When you cut through the lies, you realize the truth. American families were better when Donald Trump was president. We were safer, wealthier, and stronger.

Speaker 10 ( 02:43:06 ):

So if you love this country, if you want to stand up and fight for the future of our nation, you must re-elect Donald J. Trump.

Speaker 6 ( 02:43:26 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.

Speaker 7 ( 02:44:16 ):

And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today. Because there ain't no doubt I love this land. God bless the USA. From the lakes of Minnesota to the hills of Tennessee, across the plains of Texas from sea to shining sea, from Detroit down to Houston and New York to LA, where there's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say that I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me. And

MUSIC ( 02:44:57 ):

… to me.

( 02:44:57 ) And I'd gladly stand up next to you and defend Her still today, 'cause there ain't no doubt I love this land. God Bless the U.S.A.

( 02:44:57 ) And I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free. And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to me.

( 02:44:57 ) And I'd gladly stand up next to you and defend Her still today, 'cause there ain't no doubt I love this land. God Bless the U.S.A.

Donald Trump ( 02:46:19 ):

Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Wow. What a crowd this one is. Huh? What a crowd up in the rafters. I don't know, are you guys okay? Can you see that far? Hello up there.

I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That's what you are. And we have a country that's going to hell, but we're going to turn it around very fast.

( 02:47:16 ) And I'd like to begin with a very simple question. Very simple. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? No. So I've come today with a message of hope for all Americans with your beautiful vote. We don't want your money. I don't want your money. I want your damn vote. We want that vote. I will end inflation. I will stop the criminal invasion of our country, the biggest problem we have right now, and I will bring back the American dream. And this is all you really need to know. We have somebody who's grossly incompetent, as I guess, I don't know, is she the vice president? The president? Is she a contender? What the hell is she? Kamala broke it and I will fix it and we'll fix it very quickly and America will be bigger, better, bolder, but you're safer and stronger than ever before.

( 02:48:29 ) It's going to be, you watch, this is going to be so much fun. That's the good thing about that little slippage that they had, that little… You know? Because it showed how bad they are. It showed how bad they are. And there's never been spirit like we had. There's never been any race that we've ever had in the history of this country that's had this kind of spirit. So I just want to thank you. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, or whether we'll begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. They're going to be the four greatest years.

( 02:49:12 ) And I am asking you to, it's very hard for you to do this, to be honest with you because you look at what's happened to our country and how the hell can you do this? But I'm asking you anyway to be excited about the future of our country again. Just be excited. We're going to turn it around. And I am asking you, dream big, the American dream, just dream big. We're bringing it back. This will be America's new golden age. It's going to be the golden age. Look at this place. I mean, what the hell? How do you beat it? How do you beat it? Huh?

( 02:49:53 ) Eric? How's Eric doing? I think very well. Oh, boy. He's a great guy. He's a great-looking guy too. Sometimes I'd say maybe he'd be better off without that mustache. I'm not sure. He looks so… He's such a handsome guy. I said, I don't know, but you know, I guess you'd better leave it. Because I hear you're leading, so we have to leave the mustache, right? And you're doing great, Eric. Boy. Oh boy, we love it. We love it. We love this whole place. We had a little event here recently. You know that, right? That was the convention. We had the convention. I had a little patch on my ear. Excuse me, little patch. I said, I don't know. I was a little embarrassed walking out with a patch. But there's nothing you can do about some things. Every problem facing us can be solved. But now the fate of our nation is in your hands. It really is. We win this state, we win the whole thing. You know that?

( 02:51:15 ) On Tuesday you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala that you've had enough, that you can't take it anymore. She's been the worst vice president in the history of our country. And you remember just five months ago, everybody was saying she can't run. She's grossly incompetent. She was the worst vice president in history. We're not going to take it anymore. Kamala, you are fired. Get the hell out of here. So today was the last day for in-person early voting for most of Wisconsin. It's a little tiny section, but I'm not going to get into the detail. But you still have until Sunday to vote early here in Milwaukee as well as in Madison and Green Bay and Racine. Racine, we love Racine. We just left Green Bay. We had a great event. Was anybody at the one in Green Bay? That was a good one.

( 02:52:23 ) How's your football team? You know what I liked? I love Brett Favre and we got a call from Brett and you have to, I mean, he's a great guy. And boy, what a player. And I shook his hand. I said, man, that hand, that's the biggest hand I've ever seen. His fingers were like sausages. That's why he could throw a ball 80 yards, right? No, he was great, but he never did it before. It's such an honor because he never did it before. Thank you very much. No, Brett never did that before. As an athlete, it's hard to do a little bit. You can't do it. You lose some fans maybe, who knows, crazy people that say, "Oh, I don't like him because he likes somebody." But Brett was great and we had an unbelievable day and to get his endorsement and he wanted to do it right here, he wanted to do it right in Wisconsin. Any place, he said, in Wisconsin. And he gave me a full endorsement. And that was a great honor. That was a great honor. Great guy.

( 02:53:40 ) He could really rip that ball. So thank you very much to Brett. So get everyone you know, you have to do it. You have to vote, vote, vote. We're going to win this thing, and we're going to win it big. And I'd love to win it right here. I'd love it. And if you haven't voted early, just come on Tuesday. We don't care at this point. We don't care when you vote, just make sure you vote. And if you see anybody cheating, then what you do, you know what you do? Report them immediately. No, we're doing great. We're leading just about, I think all seven swing states we're leading. But don't listen to me now. Don't listen. Just pretend we're one down, right? We're one point down, please. We don't want to say, "Oh, we don't have to vote today because he's leading." No, don't do that. We've seen that stuff happen. We don't want to do that. Oh, the mic. Yeah, I think the mic stinks. I think it stinks.

( 02:54:37 ) All right. Crazy. Crazy. Oh, that's what… I was wondering what the hell they were shouting. I think this mic stinks, by the way. And then we don't pay the contractor. I say don't pay the contractor. Then they write a story. Trump doesn't pay his bills. He's a bad guy. No, the mic is terrible. It was, I had another one today. You know what? I've done three of these today. Somebody said, "Maybe what we could do is maybe we could just skip the last one." I said, "There's no way I'm skipping. There's no way." And this is the best one of all. Look at this place.

( 02:55:34 ) Thank you. The ladies from North Carolina, 259 of these they've come to. Look at them. They're beautiful. I don't know where the hell their husbands are. They're married. All of them are married. But they're great. And thank you very much. We're coming, we're rounding the turn, aren't we? Huh? We're rounding the turn and we have front row Joe's over here. Look at him. And we have Mr. Wall over here. What is sort of sad, is that mic now better back there? Oh, that pisses me off. They don't get it. Well, the mic at Madison Square Garden worked very well. Was that a great event? But honestly, it was basically the same crowd as you have here, right? Same thing. You're NBA Arena. Your team is very good. I would say the Greek is a seriously good player. Do you agree?

( 02:56:40 ) And tell me who has more Greek in him. The Greek or me? I think we have about the same, right? He's a great player. Maybe the best player in the NBA actually. He may be the best player. He's supposed to be a very good guy too. But with your help, we're going to defeat Kamala Harris and we're going to make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you. So in breaking news, the economy created a pitiful, you won't even believe this. The economy stinks. What timing? What timing? Four days before the election. They have among the worst numbers ever in history, nobody's ever heard. They did 12,000 jobs. Normally you're 250, 300,000, 400,000. They did 12. Think of it, 12,000 jobs.

( 02:57:49 ) And it's hundreds of thousands of jobs less than it should be. I think because they're pathetic. They don't know. These people don't know anything. She's a very low IQ person. We don't need a low IQ individual. We just had that for four years. We don't need this. But those numbers are so low, they're almost disqualifying. The only thing good about the numbers I'm going to give you now are that it's great to run against the people that created those numbers because it's terrible. And just think, a few months ago, they fraudulently claimed, remember three months ago, 818,000 jobs. It was a fraud. Everything they do is a fraud. And then they go after people that aren't frauds. They're a fraud. The whole operation stinks. But they created 818,000 fake jobs and they thought they'd get away with it. And a whistleblower blew the whistle. And they blew the whistle. They thought they were going to announce.

( 02:58:59 ) They call it a correction. That's a hell of a correction, by the way. That will be the world's biggest correction in history. What do you think, Ron Johnson? That's the biggest correction. Corrections are meant for like 700 jobs, not almost a million jobs. But now they've just revised the past jobs number, right? Your last month, and they revised it downward by 112,000 fake jobs. So these guys are playing fast and loose. These are crooked people we're dealing with. The people we're running against are crooked as hell. So that's almost a million fake jobs. And I think it's something that Congress ought to look into. Really, they ought to look at who the hell have a heard of these numbers. And they wanted to revise them after the election. Could you imagine if you lost the election? And then two days later, we've revised the numbers downward, 1 million jobs. Nobody's ever heard of it, but we thank you, Mr. Whistleblower. Some whistleblowers are very good. Kamala's failed economic agenda wiped out nearly 30,000 private sector jobs and nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs in just the last month. Do you believe this? Nobody's ever heard of these numbers. Even I, I mean, I know they're incompetent, but I thought they were sort of riding along a little bit on what we built with almost 100,000 manufacturing jobs killed since the beginning of the year. 100,000. That's a lot. 150,000. These are all the numbers coming out of the so-called government, great government. We have 150,000 Americans joined the unemployment rolls last month. This is like a depression. And there's nothing, I mean, no event. I think they're trying to blame it on the hurricane. No, that was a relatively small area. No, not the hurricane. Not the hurricane. They're the hurricane. And nearly a quarter of a million people dropped out of the labor force, which is almost unheard of.

( 03:01:09 ) No, no. These are the worst numbers anybody's ever heard of. The data shows that 100%. Listen to this part. Of all new jobs, net jobs gains in the past year have gone to illegal migrants and the jobs were taken from African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and union workers. I don't think the unions are too happy about this, but I told you this was going to happen. It was inevitable. They're letting millions and millions of people flood into the country and the African-American population, if you see these numbers, they're going to release them. But I think maybe Ron, you should try and get them early because they're really bad. They have taken so many jobs away from African-Americans. Less from Hispanic, but that's going to catch up. But the African-American job picture is unbelievable. And we had it going so good, but they've come in illegally and they've taken the jobs and people that have had jobs for 20 years and good jobs, and they raised a family.

( 03:02:21 ) They had a little house and everything nice. And they've now lost their job to illegal migrants that have poured in through the open border policy of that stupid person. Kamala's inflation nightmare. Think of this, has cost the typical American family $30,000. Think of that one. Higher prices, because the inflation's just raised and it started when they played around with my energy. I had no inflation. We had the greatest energy we've ever had. I was going to have it four times higher by now, and we're going to do that. But we got a little bit of a delay because… And we were going to have it four times higher. We're going to take care of Asia. We're going to take care of Europe. We're going to make a fortune, start paying down debt. We have 35 trillion in debt. We're going to lower your taxes. I gave you the largest tax cut in the history of our country and the largest regulation cuts, and we were able to do more. Thank you. Thank you. And now she wants to impose the largest tax hike in American history on top of everything else, and raise your taxes by more than $3,000 a year. Is everybody happy? I don't want to ruin your night, but don't worry, we're going to make it good. You've got to suffer a little bit to get them out. Get those people out. They're grossly incompetent. I stand before you today as the only candidate who can rescue our economy from total obliteration and restore it to strength, prosperity, and actual greatness. We're going to restore you to greatness. As the just-released numbers plainly indicate, the economy is now a disaster. And are you listening to this press? They're the most dishonest human beings. Or are you listening to this?

( 03:04:23 ) And these people, whenever I look at them, they turn the cameras off, the red lights go off. You see them all go. They don't want any part of it. No, that's a lot of press. That's a lot of cameras going so late at night. But no, we're going to bring it back and we're going to bring it back fast. You know what we're going to do? We're going to drill, baby drill. We're going to get the energy down. It's going to come down. We're going to drill, baby drill. But I don't know if you know it, their economy is expected to get significantly worse. How does it get worse than that? It's really bad. Top Wall Street analysts like Scott Bessent, who is one of the most brilliant guys on Wall Street, he said that the only reason the stock market is up is because everyone thinks Trump is going to win the presidency. That's pretty good. That's cool. We had a great stock going. Can you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929-style depression. I believe that too. No, that'd crush your incomes and kill millions of jobs and wipe out your savings. We're not going to let that happen. You got to get out and vote. Just got to get out. I don't like to say it's when I win. No, I sort of say, should I say when or if? I know, but it sounds a little braggadocio, right? All right. When I win, you are four days away from the best jobs, the biggest paychecks and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen.

( 03:06:16 ) Thank you. That's so nice. Thank you. Thank you. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses, and we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime. And for our seniors… Ready? No tax on social security benefits. And I am going to, this was given to me by a friend of mine, actually. This was given to me by a great political reporter, she said, "Sir, why don't you support and give a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one?" I said, "That's a good idea." So we're going to do that. Do you know if you didn't have those people, you would not have enough hospitals in this country to take care of anything? You'd need to double your hospitals. Those are the greatest people on earth and they do it with love and we are going to get them a tax credit. Is that okay? It's about time to rapidly reduce inflation. I will end Kamala's war on American energy. We're going to drill, baby drill. We're going to frack, frack, frack.

( 03:08:03 ) She goes and she says, "Oh, no. I've always wanted to frack." This woman, she's the worst liar. Look, I had to go and beat crooked Hillary Clinton. She's crooked as a $4 bill. I've never held a microphone up so long in my life. It's like I'm weightlifting. Sucker's heavy. But she's crooked as hell, right? Crooked Hillary. But she was less like, she didn't lie this way. This woman, "Trump is going to do, he's going to terminate your social security in his first week in office." No, no, no. I'm the one that's going to keep it going. No increases in age. "He's going to ruin Medicare. He is going to do that." I see her today. She's at a news conference. First of all, she's exhausted. She looks like… No, she's exhausted, right? Man. And you know what? I've gone 62 days, no days off. I've done so many. I've done so many.

( 03:09:26 ) Thank you very much. No, I've gone 62 days. Today is an example. Yesterday I started off in New Mexico. You know why? It's not really a swing state, but it's a state that likes me a lot. It's got a thing called a border and it's an open sieve, and people are pouring in by the thousands and thousands and doing a lot of destruction and doing a lot of crime. And I went there. We had a massive crowd. You couldn't even see the end of it. It was like early in the day on a regular weekday. And today I was in Michigan. We were all over the place. We were in Michigan, but I said, and Michigan's very important. We're leading in Michigan. You know why? I'm going to bring back the car business, a little thing like that.

( 03:10:14 ) I told them today, a year ago, I heard through a friend of mine who builds plants. He's a great plant builder, the best and the biggest in the world. He's building this massive plant. And I wanted to see it. I said, "I want to see the plant you're building." He goes, "Well, it's not in the U.S." I said, "Then I don't want to see it. I'm not interested. I have no interest. Where is it?" "It's in Mexico." "Who owns it?" "China." They're building this massive… They didn't start it. They're building this massive plant right on the border so they can make cars, sell them into the United States and destroy the rest of Detroit. Take all the business away from Michigan. And in all fairness, Tennessee and South Carolina and lots of other places, and you, to a lesser extent, but you too. But they're going to build this big plant.

( 03:11:02 ) And I didn't like it. I said, "That's killer." They're trying to solve the Detroit situation and we want to bring back company and we're going to bring them back. Because you know why? The most beautiful word in the entire dictionary. You know what it is? It's tariff. The tariff. You're going to become so rich with the word tariff. You're going to become rich as hell. You're not going to know what to do with the money. I'm telling you, you're going to become very rich. We were tariff. And so I told them, and I was at the Detroit Economic Club. It was beautiful. And I was giving a talk, and I saw the guy that told me that they're going to start building a big plant in Mexico, right on the border. And he was in the audience. John, his name is, he's I think, the biggest in the world at this.

( 03:11:47 ) He's very good. He told me, "If you asked me to build an apartment, I couldn't build it. Or a road, they couldn't lay the asphalt." But a plant, he has no problem with, with computers all over the place and robots. Lots of robots, by the way. So I said, "Well, how's that going?" I was making a speech and I said, "I'm right about there, where that very beautiful girl is." I'm not allowed to say that. See the beautiful blonde girl right there? I said, "Now that's the end of your political career when you do that." You're not allowed to call anybody beautiful anymore. If you do, it's the end of your political career. Ron Johnson would never do that. That's why he's a great politician. No. Right where that young lady is. John is sitting there, and I called him. I said, "Could you come back?" And he comes backstage, thank you very much. Fix the mic. You got to be kidding.

( 03:12:45 ) Do you want to see me knock the hell out of people backstage? You want to see me? I don't mind if they want to come up a little forward or something, but it's a pretty stupid situation. But that's okay. I get so angry. I'm up here seething. I'm seething. I'm working my ass off with this stupid mic. I'm blowing out my left arm. Now I'm going to blow out my right arm and I'm blowing out my throat too, because these stupid people. I'll make you a deal. Pretend you're listening to it perfectly, and I'll come back and do another one, okay? With a decent mic. It's so stupid. And the only thing I ask for, I don't care about lighting. I don't care about teleprompters because I never read the damn things anyway. By the way, isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't need a frickin teleprompter?

( 03:13:56 ) But I don't ask for much. I don't ask for much. The only thing I ask for is a good mic. And this is the second time today that this happened. So now, if I were the president and like a dopey guy like this Kelly, the guy's a total moron, and that happened, I'd fire him and everybody would say, "Gee, I'm such a bad person." You're not bad. You fire people. When, for instance, the generals that destroyed us in Afghanistan, every one of them should have been fired. Should have been fired. Hello? Hello? I don't think so. Hello? Is that better? Is that better?

( 03:14:47 ) That's terrible. Is that better back there? Is that yes or no? What crap. The only thing I ask for is a mic. You don't have to give me, I don't even need a stage. I don't give a damn. Give me a good mic. And I went through two of these today and it knocks the hell out of your throat. But so far I'm doing okay. Right? Okay. Is that better? Yeah. And did you notice I also, I came in today. I said, and this is after four of these things I've been, in all fairness, I mean, I'm a human being, right? I come in and here's the problem. I said, "Oh man, it's too low." I said, "It's too low."

( 03:15:44 ) Way too low. Way too low. So I walk in, I said, "There's nothing worse than…" I walk in like this, and I'm, Ben, did you notice I was bending over like this? And then everybody says, "Is there something wrong with his back? What the hell is wrong with that guy?" They're saying he's cognitively impaired and physically impaired. There's something wrong with them all because I have guys that are stupid back there. All right, what are you going to do? What are you going to do? Right? What a shame. But we're going to come back. I'm going to give you a free performance back in that corner. You got a bad area back there, but I think this is better. I think it's probably better.

( 03:16:34 ) But what we're doing is we're going to cut your price of energy in half, in 12 months, because we have more liquid gold under our feet than Russia, than Saudi Arabia, than anybody. Oh, that sounds much better. Does that sound better? Oh, that's good. Now I don't have to come back, but we're going to cut it because we have all this beautiful liquid gold and we're going to cut it and it's going to drive everything down. It's going to be, you are going to get, okay, ready? January 20th. First of all, you're going to vote November 5th. You're going on Tuesday. That's number one. We got to get there. I don't like talking about… Like people are coming up to me, my staff over here, who are great. "Sir, I'd like to recommend some people." I said, "I don't want to talk about any people. First I want to win."

( 03:17:28 ) Right? We don't want to talk about people. Don't tell me about people. Everybody wants a job. Remember, there was a moment where they were saying, "Oh, nobody wants to work for Trump. He's too difficult." He said, let me tell you a little secret. They'd die to work for us. Why? Because they all want to be this glamour deal. They want to be in this beautiful administration. They want to be secretaries. No, they say, "Sir, nobody wants to work for you. Nobody wants to be Secretary of State and be known, famous for the rest of your life. Nobody wants to be Secretary

Donald Trump ( 03:18:00 ):

… Secretary of the Treasury. These people are nuts. These people right there, they don't want to work for Trump. They don't want to, because he's difficult. You know why I'm difficult? Because I want perfection for our country. That's the only reason I'm difficult. So I will terminate the green new scam. One of the great scams in history. Remember, our country was going to be dead in 12 years. Remember that? Well, we came up at the 12. What happened? Where are we? Let me tell you. They have global warming, right? They said global warming. They used to call it, but now they call it climate change. You know why? Because climate change cover is cold. If it's too cold, if it's too climate change, we're suffering climate change. If it's cold, that's good. If it's hot as hell, that's good. It used to be global warming and that wasn't working, because we're actually cooling. So we have that. But the biggest warming problem we have is nuclear warming. So they talk all the time about the ocean will rise in 500 years one-eighth of an inch. Who the hell cares?

( 03:19:17 ) But we have maniacs that have nuclear weapons, so we can't let that happen. And you need a smart President. As an example. Russia would've never gone into Ukraine if I were President, zero chance with Putin. Zero. And everything Biden said, I said, he's saying the exact opposite of what he should be saying. Israel would've never happened. That attack October 7th would've never happened. What a shame, right? What a shame. You know what else wouldn't have happened, Afghanistan. The way, not we would've left sooner, but we were going to leave with dignity and strength. Instead, we lost 13 great soldiers. I know their families. Biden and Kamala would never call the families. Not even one little phone call. I don't think they really wanted to hear from them in the end, but they wouldn't call. 13 great people were lost. Many people lost the legs, the arms, the face was just horrifically injured and obliterated in some cases.

( 03:20:20 ) Nobody ever talks about them. I talk about them all the time, because those people, I mean, they're going to suffer for the rest of their lives. It's so sad. What happened, that Afghanistan, and because of that, by the way, Putin looked, he said, "Oh, the US is a paper tiger. I guess I can finally go into Ukraine," because it's the apple of his eye, always was. He told me, "No, I love it."

( 03:20:40 ) I mean, he loved it, right? He loved it. He wanted it, but he would've never done it with me. Zero chance. Zero chance. So sad. So sad. So many things have happened. You know what else wouldn't have happened to you? You would've had no inflation. I had no inflation. You wouldn't have had, inflation was caused by their stupid energy policy that drove, it drove the energy through the roof. It's not so complicated. To bring back millions of jobs, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet. And this mic is much heavier than the other one, I will say. I can do exercise.

( 03:21:27 ) I can build up my muscle, but only for those who make their product here in the USA and hire American workers for the job, right? And if these companies don't make their products here in the USA, then they will be forced to pay a very stiff tariff when they send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and taking our workers jobs. And we will now have protected companies. These companies will not leave, because they're going to be protected by tariffs, because they can't be undercut. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China. Nobody talks about it. Those guys, they don't talk about anything. They only talk about bad. They only talk about fake news. But we took in hundreds of billions, billions with a B, dollars from China. No other President took in 10 cents. Oh, you know, and I watched the other day.

( 03:22:28 ) Mrs. Obama was nasty to me. What was that all about? What was that all about, Scott Walker? Nasty. Oh, look, it's Tommy Thompson. Holy mackerel. It's Tommy. Is that Tommy Thompson or am I? Stand up, Tommy. Stand up, Scott. What a good, oh, what a couple of real pros, good guys. But Tommy, I got along with him great. In 2016, I wanted to win Wisconsin so bad. He said, "It's not doable." He said, "You are a very difficult state."

( 03:23:08 ) But I won it, you know that? I did win it, despite your difficulty. I actually won it twice, but these are minor details. Which everyone knows is actually… But Tommy Thompson, and he's a longtime governor, a longtime pro. And I said, "What do you think, Tommy? I have a big meeting," and it's hard. You have all these states, you want to go to the States.

( 03:23:32 ) And he said, "Sir, you're wasting your time if you come to Wisconsin."

( 03:23:36 ) And I said, "I don't feel that way, Tommy." I had a, I had one of these deals except with fewer people, to be honest. We become more popular with time. But it was good. It was big. I said, "I don't think so."

( 03:23:48 ) He said, "Sir, I'm telling you, you're wasting your time. But here's what I'll do. I don't want you, go to Pennsylvania. Go to Michigan, go to these places you have win. Don't do it, sir. But here's what I'm going to do," I never forgot it. It was the weirdest thing. He said, "Sir, don't do it, but if I feel you can win it or if I feel you're going to win it, if something happens over the next couple of months, I'll call you and you can do it then."

( 03:24:12 ) I said, "Wow, that's a great idea."

( 03:24:15 ) So three weeks go by and I get a phone call. They said, "Sir, there's a governor, Tommy Thompson on the phone."

( 03:24:22 ) I said, "Who the hell is that?" You sort of forget. You sort of forget, right? It's like, you're focused on… And I said, " Well, it's like Tommy." So I said, "Hi, Tommy, how are you doing? What's up?"

( 03:24:33 ) "Sir, it's time for you to get in that little chopper and come right up to Wisconsin. You're going to win this sucker." He said, "You're going to win it."

( 03:24:42 ) And he was right, right? He was right. He was right. I got in that chopper. I was up here so fast, they couldn't believe it. They couldn't believe you could travel that fast. No, and we won. We had a great victory. And I will say this, we're much more popular. This is a much bigger movement. Make America great again, MAGA, it's the greatest movement by far in the history of our country. It's amazing. There's never been anything like it, and people don't even fight it anymore really. They don't win, but it's the greatest movement. And when Biden was doing that thing with the purple background, do you remember that? He looked like the devil, right? Remember that? Sebastian, have you gotten taller, Sebastian? What's going on with you? Sebastian, do you remember? Why are you standing? Do they not have a seat for you? He's giving me applause before we, he's a great guy. Does everybody listen to his show?

( 03:25:49 ) He's been loyal. I'll tell you one thing. That guy was with me through thick and thin, anything that came up. He said, "The President is innocent."

( 03:25:59 ) I said, "Oh, thank you, Sebastian."

( 03:26:01 ) He would say, "I don't know exactly what they're accusing him of, but he's innocent."

( 03:26:05 ) No, Sebastian has been great. He's been a very good, loyal friend, really good friend, and really talented guy, smart, savant. But we are now more popular. This is the weave. A little weave, right? They used to say, these are stupid people. They used to say, "He rambled."

( 03:26:26 ) I don't ramble. I do a weave. You know what a weave is? It's a story. And as you're telling the story, you realize that there's a little offshoot, go up here. But the key is then you have to come back, and then you're doing the story, you're getting down to bottom line and boom, you do another little weave.

( 03:26:45 ) Then sometimes you do a weave off a weave. It's here and then back. It's called the weave, and one guy got it right, a writer. They said, "Trump is a totally brilliant guy." He said, "I've never seen anything…"

( 03:27:02 ) Because you always have to end up in the right place, or then you're rambling. Then you're rambling. But no, I have a very, very fertile, very fertile brain. But it's the weave and we do it, and it covers a lot of territory. This way, you tell one story and you cover really, it's like 15 subplots, but you get down to the final answer and actually they're starting to say it. You know who said it? Do you know who said it? Rogan. Did anyone see that? What a nice guy. What a good guy, because that's called long form. Joe Rogan. That's called long form. So you're with him and you're talking, and you don't have to rush your answer, cram it in, right?

( 03:27:48 ) I like the way, by the way, 60 minutes. See, this is part of the weave too? I like the way 60 Minutes, in order… She doesn't do a weave. She doesn't know where the hell she is. She gave the worst answer I've ever heard to a question. One of the main questions, she was on 60 Minutes, Kamala was. You can't call her Harris, because nobody knows who Harris is. Have you seen Harris lately? Who the hell is Harris? So you call her Kamala, but on 60 Minutes they did something that was amazing. I never thought. I think it's the worst scandal in the history of broadcast. I mean, I think it's the worst scandal. She gave an answer, which showed that she was grossly incompetent, grossly. It was the crazy. It was just like all words. They had no meaning, no effect. They took the entire answer.

( 03:28:40 ) They said, "Yes, we adjusted it slightly. Yeah."

( 03:28:43 ) They took the entire answer out, threw it away, and they took an answer down here that had nothing to do with it, and put it, which was still crappy, but at least you could make a case. So they took the answer out and they put in a new answer. And I said, that's terrible. This is, it's part of the news division. They get free licensing. They're worth billions, by the way, but the government brilliantly gives it to them for nothing, and they're all crooked. ABC's crooked as hell. Look at this David Muir, the way he was asking stuff. This guy, pretty boy. And his hair's not as good as it used to be, by the way. It used to be much better. But you know what? He was asking stuff. I said, what the hell is he asking?

( 03:29:30 ) He said, "Crime went down."

( 03:29:32 ) I said, "Only a fool would say crime went down."

( 03:29:33 ) Crime didn't go down. It went… And then the following day, right, it came out, crime was up 49%. It's terrible. But what 60 Minutes did is unbelievable. They took the answer out. They replaced it with another answer. You got to see them trying to explain, Sebastian. They're trying to explain why they did that one. Did you ever do that? Would you ever do that? See, he may do that for me, but I don't think so, right? If he did, he wouldn't be talking about it. That I could tell you. But he may. I don't want people to do that.

( 03:30:04 ) You know what they do? They take mine. Mine is a beautiful, beautiful answer. But here's what they do. They cut out part of the weave and then it doesn't sound so good anymore. But what 60 Minutes did and CBS, I think the license should be taken away from CBS. And I think that 60 Minutes should be forced to either close or take a very extended stay. And I'll tell you what. If a conservative broadcaster ever did what they did, it would be the end of their lives. Everybody would be in jail. Everybody would be in jail. What they did. And so in honor of you, we sued them yesterday for a lot of money.

( 03:30:55 ) We sued them and I sued them. And we call it election interference fraud. It's election, it's a fraud. And I don't think there's any real way. I don't believe there's any way they can even answer it. You want to know the truth? But as we rescue our economy, I will restore our borders, because I think that's your biggest problem. I do. They're destroying our country. They're putting dangerous people. Look at these beautiful people. You'll be interspersed with murderers, drug dealers, terrorists. Do we have any in the house right now? Are there any people? Over the past four years, Kamala has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted on our people. She's violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border, and unleashed an army of gangs and criminal migrants from prisons and jails, insane asylums and mental institutions all around the world.

( 03:32:03 ) From the Congo in Africa to Venezuela, Venezuelan crime is down like 72% right? Because they put their criminals into the United States of America. Thank you, thank you. Our stupid leaders, and they're stealing countless American lives. You'll see that in a couple of minutes. It's horrible what's going on. It's a terrible situation. Today, I want to hear directly from a mother whose world has been absolutely shattered. This is a young, beautiful mother who I met at one of the rallies, and we said, "Do you mind if we do this? You were so…"

( 03:32:41 ) So I had some of the toughest people I've ever seen with me. They were all crying when they saw this. Wait till you see this, please.

Speaker 16 ( 03:32:51 ):

Sunday night, I asked her to not stay up super late, because of her coming to work with me in the morning, first to do her summer school. She said, "Okay."

( 03:33:03 ) I told her, "Good night, and I love you."

( 03:33:05 ) I went to bed, not realizing that that was going to be the last time I saw her. We're best friends.

Speaker 18 ( 03:33:12 ):

Yeah!

Speaker 16 ( 03:33:12 ):

We're going shake it again. I woke up to notice she wasn't in her bed. I am in my heart trying not to lose my mind, because I don't know where she is. I finally remembered her phone had a location on, and her phone was pinging just two minutes down the road, right behind the skate park. I start driving to the direction the phone was being pinged at, and I see a couple cop cars with lights on. I see yellow tape, and immediately my heart drops and sinks to the bottom of my stomach. My daughter's hands and ankles were both bound. She was strangled to death, left with no pants. And I know in my heart she fought incredibly hard. She was not going down without a fight.

Speaker 17 ( 03:34:18 ):

We begin with two men we're learning our charge with capital murder tonight, accused of killing a 12-year-old girl.

Speaker 19 ( 03:34:24 ):

Police say these men strangled her, before dumping her into that creek. Both men were in the country illegally.

Speaker 20 ( 03:34:30 ):

Apprehended, then released by border patrol, less than three weeks before Jocelyn's death. The men accused of killing Jocelyn Nungare are affiliated with the gang known for brutal violence.

Speaker 16 ( 03:34:41 ):

Kamala Harris was in charge of immigration in our borders. If we had better border policies and not open borders, and not these catch-and-release policies, I truly believe this all could have been prevented. Under her being Vice President of this country, my daughter's life was ripped away from her. She had her entire life ahead of her.

Speaker 21 ( 03:35:08 ):

Happy birthday, dear Jocelyn, happy birthday…

Speaker 16 ( 03:35:13 ):

My daughter is six feet in the ground based off of policies that she allowed to keep. Kamala Harris did have one job, and she not only failed, not me, she failed my daughter. She failed Jocelyn.

Speaker 22 ( 03:35:31 ):

[inaudible 03:35:31] get it in my mouth.

Speaker 16 ( 03:35:32 ):

She was only 12. President Trump reached out, gave me his sincerest condolences as not a former President, but just as a father, someone who cares. I believe Donald Trump needs to be back in office. I can at least know that my next child will be safe in this country.

Donald Trump ( 03:36:07 ):

This is what we're letting into our country. This is what we're letting in. And you could take that scene and multiply it times thousands, whether it's on highways, whether it's just shootings, plain shootings. These are rough people. Rough, rough people. And we can't take it. And it's the worst thing that's happening to our country. I think it's the worst thing that's happened to our country in decades. Nobody's ever even imagined a thing, where other countries will take their prisons and open them, and drop everybody, thousands of their prisoners. You know what they save by doing that?

( 03:36:43 ) And I know most of the heads of these countries, it's like they can't believe they got away with it. And as soon as I heard we were going to have open borders, I said, "I know immediately that that's what's going to be done."

( 03:36:56 ) They're opening their jails and their prisons, and their mental institutions, and they're becoming empty. Some are already empty, but all over the world, this is all over the world. This isn't just in South America. It's not just Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras. You think in terms of a little close, these are all over the world. Big, big in the Congo. Big, big. They're sending them over. Big, tough. They're tough. They're tough. And they're mean. They're mean. The day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins.

( 03:37:43 ) The savages charged with brutalizing and murdering precious Jocelyn are members of the same vicious Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua, that's taken over apartment complexes and unleashing violent killing sprees all over America. All over America. Think of it. They're in Colorado. I think Colorado's going to vote for Trump. You know what they did? They were the ones that led the thing to get me up. I was the leading candidate of both parties, leading the Republicans and leading the Democrats. Leading the Democrats one-to-one. I was the leading candidate. And then they talk about a threat to democracy. And that governor, a radical left lunatic who was petrified of the gangs that are taken over his state, this guy went and told his people to try and get me off the ballot. Can you imagine that? That would've been a fine mess. That would've been a fine mess for the country, wouldn't it?

( 03:38:46 ) And went to the Supreme Court of the United States, won nine to nothing, because even the justice that were liberally inclined, the justices that were liberally inclined, they said, "We can't do that. You got to beat them at the ballot box."

( 03:39:01 ) It was very, actually, it was very heartwarming to see it as a nine to nothing. But this governor in Colorado did it. And you know who hated him the most are the Democrats in Colorado. They thought it was terrible. The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer. November 5th, 2024 will be Liberation Day in America. Liberation Day.

( 03:39:31 ) And on day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered. These towns have been conquered. Think of what that means, conquered. And we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of our country immediately. And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua criminals and MS-13 criminals, which are just about as bad. We took out thousands of MS-13s. They loved Long Island. Isn't that nice? Do you know? Two beautiful girls, 16 years old, were walking to school one day and MS-13 attacked the two girls, and they sliced them up with knives. They didn't want to shoot them, because that's too quick and not painful enough. They took and they killed both girls. And it's lucky that we have ICE around, because ICE was extremely good. They were extremely good.

( 03:40:42 ) And this fool that we have running for President, without having gotten one single vote to his 14 million votes, this fool wanted to defund ICE. We want to defund ICE. If you defunded ICE, you had nobody that's tough enough to go in there and get these animals out of our country. She wanted to defund ICE. I will invoke the… And this is incredible, because we had to go back so far. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. That's when they ran a tough country to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I am here by calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.

( 03:41:53 ) And I will immediately ban all sanctuary cities in the United States of America. We'll have them no longer. And despite all the damage she has caused, Kamala has spent the final week of her campaign comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. You know that, right? All of us, you, me. Two days ago, Joe Biden called our supporters garbage. He called them garbage. That's worse than deplorables, isn't it? Remember Hillary? How did that work out with deplorables? Well, garbage is working out even worse for him. They called you, all of us, garbage. We're garbage. And I believe we have 250 million people. I believe we have, most of the country is about making America great again.

( 03:42:55 ) And my response to Joe and Kamala is very simple. You can't lead America if you don't love Americans. You just can't do it. Doesn't work. And you can't be President if you hate the American people. And I actually think they hate the American people. She's not a good person. Her help, 95% of her help left. Do you know when she was in the DA's office in California, she made everybody stand at attention when she walked in. Good morning, madam. Good morning. They were told to say, good morning, Madam District Attorney. Stand up at attention. She's not a good person. Kamala's closing message to Americans is that I believe she hates you. I do believe that. I mean, I do believe that. My closing message is that I love America, and I'm inviting you to join us in building an extraordinary future for our nation.

( 03:44:12 ) My oath of office is an oath of allegiance to you. The American people. We're going to straighten this mess out. It's a mess. It's an incompetent mess. I mean, she can't answer. She can't. I see her being interviewed yesterday. She can't answer a question. She goes all over the place. She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about. She's crazy. It's crazy. I'm asking for your vote, but I want you to know that whether you vote for me or not, when I win, I will fight for you with every breath in my body, I'm going to fight very hard, whether you vote for me or not. I took a lot of heat about two months ago, because I said, I think women like me, I do. I think the suburban housewives like me, I do. I think it's a con job by these people. I think it's all, it's a lot of crap. But I think they do. And I said, I think they like me, because they know I'm going to protect them. And they said it's such a horrible thing. I said, no, I want to protect the women of our country. I want to protect them in many ways. I want to protect them in many ways. But some of the ways are, suburban housewives, they say, don't like me. I think they do like me, because thank you. And she'd say, "I love you."

( 03:45:52 ) Where do you live? What part of Westchester do you live?

Speaker 23 ( 03:46:00 ):

Illinois.

Donald Trump ( 03:46:00 ):

Oh, well, that's nice. Illinois. Illinois. You may have the worst governor in the entire country. Thank you very much. And he's terrible. They threw him out of the family business, so he decides to run for governor. I know the Pritzker. I know the Pritzker family very well. I was partners with him actually. They have some good people, but they threw him out, because he was not very good. And he ends up running for governor, because he is got money, but he's terrible. But I'm not allowed to use the fat word. That's the other word you cannot use. You are not allowed to use the fat word. So I will not do it, but that guy is disgusting.

( 03:47:09 ) Everything Kamala says is a lie. Her entire campaign is one hoax and slander after another. But the more they lie, the more they smear, the more you need to get out and vote. We're going to get rid of these people. We're going to get rid of them fast. Right? The only way to stop the lies is to swamp them. We got to swamp them. Swamp them with that vote. It's true. Kamala has no vision. She has no ideas. She's got no brain power. She's got no solutions. All she can talk about, all… Did you see her the other night? All she can talk about is Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump.

Kamala Harris ( 03:47:51 ):

Good evening, everyone. Tonight I will speak about Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Trump.

Donald Trump ( 03:48:16 ):

All she talks about. You know, there are some people who thrive under pressure, and there are some people who crack under pressure. She cracks under pressure, and the more pressure Kamala is under, the worst, the worse she crumbles. She is, at this point, very rattled. You take a look at her. She may, is there a chance she would resign before the election in three days? I actually think they should have left Joe. I think he would've done just as well, maybe better. And it's come out today upon extremely good authority, the press, therefore it's no authority, but it's come out today that Joe Biden likes me more than he likes Kamala.

( 03:49:06 ) And that he would rather have me win than Kamala win, because they took away his Presidency. It's the first time in the history of the Presidency. They stole the Presidency from him. He would rather have me win. Actually, I think psychologically he's better off. It's a much better story for him. What they did is terrible. They went in and they said, "You're out, Joe."

( 03:49:28 ) Can you imagine? You're the President of the United States, and you have crazy Nancy. She's crazy as a bed bug. Crazy Nancy who had a lot of Visa stock, and she sold it one day before it was announced that Visa is under major investigation, and the fake news doesn't do anything about it. And then you have Kamala, who couldn't do an interview with Joe Rogan, who frankly is very fair. I call him tough, but fair, but he's great, great guy. We had the largest, it was the biggest interview. He did me last week, as you might've heard. The biggest interview that he's ever done in terms of hits, hits, hits.

( 03:50:13 ) Over a hundred million. Much more than a hundred million. How much? Like a hundred? Where's TikTok Jack? He knows everything. There's TikTok. He's a TikToker. You know, if they're 20 years old and they work here, I have a guy, TikTok Jack. When they turn 20, they're finished in that business. No, they're too old. Much too old. Then you get sued for age discrimination. If she can't handle an interview, then she can't handle certainly President Xi of China, President Putin, he would've never done it. She can't handle anything, but she's not equipped for that. She's not a President. She'll get overwhelmed, meltdown, and millions of people will die. You going to die? This is not a charity event. This is an

Donald Trump ( 03:51:00 ):

… election for the biggest and toughest job anywhere in the world. This is the toughest job in the world, with the most at stake, right?

( 03:51:11 ) So do you want to lose your life savings because we put a weak and foolish and incompetent person in the White House? I don't think so. Do you want to lose your job and maybe your house and pension because Kamala has the economic understanding of a child?

Audience ( 03:51:26 ):

No.

Donald Trump ( 03:51:28 ):

The presidency is a job held by Teddy Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower, George Washington, and even Ronald Reagan: people of strength and intelligence, people that have a leadership quality. Would you trust Kamala Harris to talk with Russia or China about nuclear war? I don't think so. I really don't. Would you trust her to steer us out of an economic crisis? I don't think so.

( 03:52:05 ) Nothing is more dangerous than to give immense power to a very weak and incompetent person with an extremely low IQ. We had enough of low IQs in the last four years. We can't go through another person who's a dummy. We can't do it. You wouldn't put Kamala Harris in charge of even a kindergarten class. You can't do it. You can't do it.

( 03:52:35 ) So at the end of the day, you need to ask yourself, can you afford to put someone this incompetent in charge of our country's future? No, you can't. No, you can't. But on top of it all, Kamala says she would not do anything different, not one thing different than Joe Biden did. In other words, she should not run for office, because he was the worst ever. Take a look.

Video ( 03:53:00 ):

Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?

( 03:53:06 ) There is not a thing that comes to mind.

( 03:53:08 ) I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.

( 03:53:11 ) The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan stunned Americans and the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.

( 03:53:19 ) Would you have done something differently?

( 03:53:21 ) There is not a thing that comes to mind.

( 03:53:23 ) More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught at the border and then released into the United States.

( 03:53:30 ) An Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an election-day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

( 03:53:38 ) Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia nursing student, Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.

( 03:53:51 ) Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder and the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

( 03:53:57 ) A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.

( 03:54:05 ) Would you have done something differently?

( 03:54:07 ) There is not a thing that comes to mind.

( 03:54:09 ) Only 18% say the economy is in excellent or good condition.

( 03:54:13 ) US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.

( 03:54:20 ) Authorities say Tren de Aragua, which has been linked with more than 100 criminal investigations here in the US, has now been found operating its criminal enterprise in apartment complexes. Were you the last person in the room?

( 03:54:31 ) Yes.

Donald Trump ( 03:54:35 ):

Thank you. There is nothing that would come to mind. Can you imagine? How about the 325,000 children that she could have saved if she had the correct policy? No, she doesn't want to bring that up either. No. She actually would have changed things, but she couldn't think of it. She didn't have enough time. She only had about four days to prepare. If you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote. We're going to solve this problem very quickly. It's going to happen fast. It's going to be beautiful to watch. We're pleased to be joined today by your next senator from the great state of Wisconsin, Eric Hovde. Eric, thank you very much. Going to have a great, great career. He's a good man too. Good man. Loves the state.

( 03:55:25 ) And is he central casting? And I'll tell you what, she is a disaster. Okay? She's a horror show. Thanks as well to Senators Ron Johnson… Ron, stand up. Wow. Good man. He's a good man. He really is. Thank you, Ron. Great job. Great job. Thank you.

( 03:55:49 ) We have a man who's just become recently… He was a great attorney general and he's now a senator. He won a big race, a tough race, a race that everybody said, "Well, there's no way anybody's going to win this race." He beat somebody that was supposed to win and he's become a star in the Senate. Eric Schmitt. Eric, thank you. Thank you.

( 03:56:15 ) And from the great state of Oklahoma… I love Oklahoma. You know they have 77 counties? And I won all 77. You know who second was? Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan was second. He won 56. I won 77. I have to move there immediately. I have to move. Markwayne Mullin. Thank you, Markwayne. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Markwayne.

( 03:56:42 ) And we have representatives, Bryan Steil… How are you doing with the ActBlue or whatever it's called? You got to get it done before the election. He's working on one of the biggest scandals in the country. It's like where the Democrats put money into the ActBlue or whatever the hell they call it, and massive amounts of money and everybody's talking, and he's in charge. So we're going to blame you if nothing happens, right? No, but everybody knows it was a rip. But honestly, you got to get this stuff done before elections, not after elections, and we learned that. They're finding all sorts of things now in Pennsylvania. Who would've thought you had to do this? But good luck with that, Brian. That's so important. Okay? Thanks. Good luck. Scott Fitzgerald. Scott, thank you very much. Thank you. Great. Good job you're doing. Kevin Hern. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you. We appreciate it. These are warriors, by the way. And a real warrior. He grew up here and he moved to Texas. He's one of the most popular guys in Texas. He's a congressman. He could do anything he wanted. They love him. And he actually asked for a leave of absence. He said, "If you don't mind, I'd like to go to Wisconsin, where I grew up. I want to help the President win that state." He left Texas. And you know what Texas said? "We love you for doing it because we have no problem."

( 03:58:07 ) And we win Texas by a lot. This is always a little bit tighter. It shouldn't be tighter. It should be the same thing. Oh, I wish it was the same thing. Texas has been so good, but they view him as a hero for doing this, as opposed to, "Gee, why is he not in Texas?" And he's been up here for four months. He's got his brothers helping him. He's a great congressman and he's a fantastic man. Troy Nehls. Thank you, Troy. Have your brothers stand up. Your brothers. Stand up, fellows. Boy. But the whole family came up here. Really, they came up just to help me. It was really incredible.

( 03:58:47 ) And candidate for Congress. I don't want to mess with this guy. He's a big powerful man. Randy Niemeyer. Thank you, Randy. Look at the size of that guy. I met him backstage, Scott. I met him and I said, "Wow." And former governors, Scott Walker and Tommy Thompson, great people. Thank you, Scott. Great. Two great guys. A very respected man in DC and here, a friend of mine, a great lawyer, Reince Priebus. Reince? Thank you, Reince. Thank you, Reince.

( 03:59:24 ) And we loved Bobby Kennedy, didn't we? Didn't we? We loved him. Everybody loves him. I have a deal with him because he's really into the environment, but he's really into health. I say, "Bobby, you take care of health. You work on those potatoes and work on those oranges. You work on everything. Everything. You can work on everything. The only thing you got to leave alone, Bobby, just leave it alone, is the liquid gold, because we're going to make a fortune."

( 03:59:57 ) "I don't want you telling me I can't touch it." The only thing I've asked Bobby to just… Please, Bobby, don't tell me it's like a problem. Please. Because we're going to make so much damn money. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation in the world, including Saudi Arabia, including Saudi Arabia and Russia. I took it from number four to number one. We're number one. We're energy-independent. Can you imagine? Mr. Wall. Please stand up, Mr. Wall. I'm going to buy that suit. I'm going to buy that suit. Susie, please buy that suit for me.

( 04:00:38 ) We also have the head of our campaign on today, and other than this microphone, she's done an unbelievable job this year. Unbelievable. It's the best-run campaign. Well, actually, to say it's the best-run campaign, you got to win. Do you mind if I wait about four days? But Susie, wow. She's incredible. Incredible.

( 04:01:03 ) You know who's her father? I believe in this stuff so much. Pat Summerall, right? Great announcer, great football player, great announcer. Look, he's going, "Wow, that's very impressive." But no, we believe in genetics a little bit, right? But Susie's done an incredible job, and thank you, Susie. You really have. And Chris and everybody else, right? Thank you, everybody. Appreciate it.

( 04:01:27 ) Former small-business administrator, Jovita Carranza. Thank you, Jovita. Jovita, thank you. Jovita did a good job. And Sebastian, we want to thank you very much. Sebastian Gorka, everybody. And a man who I think is going to bring us home, GOP Chairman, Brian Schimming. Thank you, Brian. What a good job you're doing.

( 04:01:57 ) I heard him speak the other day. I was in the plane flying in and he was up [inaudible 04:02:02] you are good. You are psyched, right? We all are. We want to win. This is the biggest win. This will be the biggest win. Think of it. And if we win the whole thing, it'll be the greatest event in political history in this country and maybe beyond. The greatest. And not only great because it's a great event. It's going to be great because of what we're going to be able to do. We're going to be able to fix our country. That's why it's really going to be great. It's going to be very important.

( 04:02:28 ) And a friend of mine, one of the greatest developers, a great guy, a very generous person, he's always giving money to charity when there's a problem. Like in North Carolina, he wanted to go with me, wrote out a big check all the time. He's a fantastic man. Steve Witkoff. Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Steve. Great guy.

( 04:02:49 ) So in conclusion, here are the facts. Kamala is a radical left Marxist, rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas herself. Remember Pocahontas? Her mother said she had high cheekbones, which I think is very racist for somebody to say that. I think it's a racist statement. I think you should investigate that statement.

( 04:03:13 ) She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of Defund The Police movement, and anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week or one day is not worthy of being President of the United States. Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorse a total ban on handgun ownership. Who in this room is willing to give up their gun, please, to Kamala?

Audience ( 04:03:42 ):

No.

Donald Trump ( 04:03:45 ):

Who refuses to give up their gun?

Audience ( 04:03:48 ):

Yeah.

Donald Trump ( 04:03:51 ):

I think she has a very tough job, but she even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens and detention at taxpayer expense. And perhaps worst of all, she lied about working at McDonald's. She lied. She never worked at McDonald's. Never worked there. She never worked there. She's a liar. It was always, "Oh, I saw…" I went and checked it out. Actually, they were the best french fries I ever had. Nine seconds after taking them out of that fat, whatever the hell, but they were the best. You know when they sit around for about two hours? Not so good. With your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America.

( 04:04:43 ) We will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to a place called Wisconsin. We will build American, we will buy American, and we will hire American. That's what we want. And I will end the war in Ukraine. It would have never happened if I was President. And I will stop the chaos in the Middle East. October 7th would have never happened. All those people would be alive right now. And I will prevent World War Three. We're not going to have World War Three. With these people, you'll have it, and it would be a war like no other because of the power of the weaponry. We will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect that they so dearly deserve.

( 04:05:38 ) We will strengthen and modernize our military. We will build a missile defense shield over our country, all made in the USA, and we will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we will put in a bill in to Congress. They say it's unconstitutional. I don't know why, but we're going to protect our great American flag. Anybody burning the American flag or destroying our American flag gets one year in jail. Thank you very much.

( 04:06:28 ) And we will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women's sports. Yes? I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms. Our Second Amendment will be totally protected. After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country and defend our borders and protect our citizens and our land, right?

( 04:07:12 ) And we will stop illegal immigration once and for all. It will be stopped. And we want people to come into our country. We do. We want people, but they have to come in legally through a system. They have to love us. They have to love our country. We will not be invaded. We are not going to be invaded. It's like an invasion. It's like a military invasion. The guns and weapons some of these guys have, they're military grade. They're at least military grade. Some are better than military grant.

( 04:07:45 ) We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be overrun. We will not be conquered. We will be a free and proud nation once again. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. And more than anything else, it will be filled with a thing called the American Dream. We're going to have the American Dream back. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda with a landslide that is just too big to rig.

( 04:08:26 ) So you need to get out and vote. For the past nine years, we have been fighting against the most sinister and corrupt forces on earth. They are corrupt, sinister, horrible people. Horrible people. With your vote in this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. All of you. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country, and four days from now, it is hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country.

( 04:09:05 ) You're going to save our country, and I would love to see you do it, because you deserve it. You've been very loyal to me. I won all my primaries here. I won everything here. I had a little slip up with some bad things that happened in one election, but everybody understands it. And Jesus, we just had tremendous success here. I have so many friends here, incredible people.

( 04:09:34 ) And remember when you're about to press that lever, and I told you this before, everybody wanted that damn boat contract to build 28 destroyer-type boats. And I'm a very visual person. So I took the thing that was designed, which wasn't that beautiful, and I took the bow of the boat, and I reshaped it with the yard. You know the yard we're talking about? Great yard. That's correct. Thank you very much. And I took it and I said, "No, you got to have a little more point." Ooh, you got to see this thing. It looks like a yacht with lots of guns on it. And they've done a great job. And everybody wanted. Every state wanted it. Some of them won't even talk to me still.

( 04:10:16 ) But I wanted one of the biggest contracts. That was one of the biggest contracts. Ron helped me a lot, and I wanted it to go to Wisconsin, and it went to Wisconsin, and they're building their little hearts out. So when you're ready to press that lever, Sebastian, remember that beautiful boat. Remember the yacht with guns all over it.

( 04:10:36 ) After all we've been to, and we have been through a lot, but after all that we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. We're going to make them great years. We're going to make them great years. With your help from now until election day, four days, we will restore America's promise and we will take back the nation that we love. We love this nation. I mean, I wouldn't be doing this. I could have a hell of an easy life. I could have those waves just smacking me in the face. Beautiful saltwater waves all over the place. I got waves all over the place. Lots of places with lots of waves. Mr Witkoff can confirm that, right, Steve? Probably more than anybody. I don't have to be here. But if I had my choice, I'd rather be right here with a broken-down shit microphone in Wisconsin. I would rather be in Wisconsin than some beautiful beach. I would rather be right here, because we are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.

( 04:11:46 ) We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down. We will never, ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight, and we will win, win, win. We're going to start winning again. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country, and together, we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. Thank you, RFK Jr. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much, Wisconsin. God bless you. God bless you all. Thank you.
