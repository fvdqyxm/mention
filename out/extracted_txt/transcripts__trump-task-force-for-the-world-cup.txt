Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Thank you very much. We're going to be establishing a task force, a very important task force, White House, and that's on the FIFA World Cup of 2026, which as you know, is a big event. It's going to be the biggest event, I think. And Gianni, I think you're going to say a few words. Everybody knows this man in the right. He's sort of the king of soccer, I guess in a certain way. He was the one that was able to give it to us, and we're going to do a fantastic job in making you at home. So I very much appreciate it. First time it's ever been in this part of the world and it's an honor. Thank you very much, Gianni.

Gianni ( 00:38 ):

Thank you. Thank you, President. Thank you, President. Well, it is a great achievement to bring the World Cup next year, the FIFA World Cup in '26 here in the United States, together with Mexico and Canada. And this summer actually, we have a new competition, the FIFA Club World Cup in '25 from the 14th of June to the 13th of July, only in the United States of America. 11 cities, 12 stadiums, the best players in the world, the best teams in the world. America will welcome the world. There will be millions of people coming, Mr. President, millions of people. The economic impact is 40 billion US dollars between now and next year. We will create 200,000 jobs for these two World Cups. And more than that, we'll give joy and happiness to the entire world. And this is priceless. Definitely. So thank you, Mr. President for setting up this task force because it is important that everyone that comes to America feels safe, feels welcome.

( 01:51 ) And that's why it's important that the government puts together this White House task force chaired by the president himself. It shows the importance of the FIFA World Cups, I should say, because there are many, many topics to deal with, of course and we want everyone who comes to America and who goes to watch one of these games. We have 10 million tickets for sale. It's like three Super Bowls every day for one month that everyone that goes feels safe, feels happy, and feels that we are doing something special. So we are here to create and to make the best show on the planet ever. And we'll do it together, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 02:42 ):

Oh, that's great. I love what he said, like three Super Bowls a day for a month. That's what it is.

Gianni ( 02:47 ):

That's what it is.

Donald Trump ( 02:48 ):

That's really amazing when you think of it. I've never heard that expression. That's a lot. When we made this, it was made during my term, my first term, and it was so sad because I said, can you imagine? I'm not going to be president. And that's too bad. And then what happened is they rigged the election and I became president so that was a good thing. That was a good thing. That was quite an achievement for both of us. So I'll be president during the World Cup and during the Olympics, which we were very instrumental in getting.

( 03:20 ) And then of course we have our 250th birthday too. When of that, I wasn't instrumental. That just happened to fall on the same time. So we have those three big events. You don't get very much bigger than that. The Olympics, the World Cup and number 250. And it's a great honor. But I appreciate your selecting us and we were selected a long time ago though during the term, during my first term, and it's an honor to be with you, Gianni.

Gianni ( 03:46 ):

Thank you. My honor.

Donald Trump ( 03:47 ):

You've been my friend for a long time.

Gianni ( 03:48 ):

Absolutely.

Donald Trump ( 03:49 ):

He's a great gentleman. Okay, I'll sign this and that makes it official, right?

Gianni ( 03:52 ):

That makes it official, yes.

Donald Trump ( 03:54 ):

That's good.

Gianni ( 03:54 ):

Here we are. Then we have to start working.

Ryan ( 03:56 ):

Can you talk a little bit about the halftime show that you anticipate for the championship? Will it be like the Super Bowl halftime show or better?

Gianni ( 04:06 ):

Well, the Super Bowl has around a hundred million viewers or 150 million viewers. The World Cup final is two billion viewers. So we have to make it 20 times better and 20 times bigger than the Super Bowl.

Donald Trump ( 04:20 ):

I think it'll be better. I think it will be better.

Ryan ( 04:22 ):

Any idea the economic impact of this in all these cities around the country? It's got to be huge.

Gianni ( 04:27 ):

Yeah, it's huge. It's around 40 billion in only the United States, 40 billion US dollars. The economic impact, 200,000 jobs created. Per city, you can divide by 11 and a little bit what each city gets more or less. Some cities get more, others get less, but we'll have 10 million tourists coming, some with tickets, others without tickets who just want to be here during these World Cups.

Donald Trump ( 04:57 ):

What team is favored now if there's such a thing? I mean, do they have a team? So many of these great famous teams, what team seems to be favored?

Gianni ( 05:05 ):

Well, on the club one, which takes place this year, of course, Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, the Germans, Paris Saint-Germain, the French, the big ones are always there. And these clubs are multinationals. They have players from all countries.

Donald Trump ( 05:20 ):

They always seem to be there.

Gianni ( 05:22 ):

They're always there.

Donald Trump ( 05:23 ):

Those great teams.

Gianni ( 05:24 ):

They're always there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then next year, Argentina, Brazil, England, Germany, Spain.

Donald Trump ( 05:30 ):

It's going to be great.

Gianni ( 05:31 ):

So it'll be great.

Donald Trump ( 05:31 ):

Any questions for Gianni?

Ryan ( 05:34 ):

U.S.

Gianni ( 05:34 ):

U.S, U.S, U.S is coming up. U.S is coming. Watch the U.S. Some very, very good players. Playing in Europe, but we need to bring them back here to play here.

Donald Trump ( 05:42 ):

Can the U.S win?

Gianni ( 05:44 ):

The U.S can win, yes. With the public behind-

Donald Trump ( 05:46 ):

See, he knows what to say.

Gianni ( 05:53 ):

No, they're playing some of the top teams.

Donald Trump ( 05:53 ):

He knows.

Gianni ( 05:53 ):

They're playing some of the top teams.

Donald Trump ( 05:53 ):

So there's a shot, right?

Gianni ( 05:53 ):

Yeah, there is a shot, absolutely. Yes.

Donald Trump ( 05:54 ):

That's great. Well, we'll hold that up for you guys. Ryan, did you have another question?

Ryan ( 06:04 ):

I was just going to say, this continues your pursuit to bring America back in every aspect, the economy, world peace, sports now, which is awesome. Maybe preview a little bit of the Olympics, I know you talked about that before.

Donald Trump ( 06:19 ):

I'm just very happy to have done it. I mean, I didn't think this was going to happen. I said I'll be sitting there but not as president so I was very honored. Actually, Gianni reminded me, called me up very early on. He said, you're going to be president during this whole thing after we won. So it's a great honor for our country to have it actually. It's a big deal. I don't know which is bigger, the Olympics or the World Cup. What is the story on that? Can I ask you that question?

Gianni ( 06:48 ):

No. The World Cup is much, much, much bigger than the Olympics. Come on. And it's in the whole country. Olympics is in one country.

Donald Trump ( 06:55 ):

We've got them both.

Speaker 4 ( 06:58 ):

Mr. President, it's a long way off, Mr. President, but do you foresee yourself attending some matches or a match?

Donald Trump ( 07:03 ):

Oh yeah, sure. I would like to. I'd like to go to certainly more than one. We'll be making the rounds. It's a period of a month and it's really top of the line. It's one of the great events. Maybe one of the great events of anywhere in the world.

Speaker 5 ( 07:16 ):

Mr. President, since you last spoke about it yesterday, some details have come out about your cabinet meeting with Elon Musk and some clashes eventually between Secretary Rubio and Secretary-

Donald Trump ( 07:27 ):

No clash. I was there. You're just a troublemaker. And you're not supposed to be asking that question because we're talking about the World Cup. Elon gets along great with Marco and they're both doing a fantastic job. There is no clash.

Speaker 5 ( 07:41 ):

Mr. President-

Donald Trump ( 07:42 ):

Who are you with? Who are you with?

Speaker 5 ( 07:43 ):

NBC.

Donald Trump ( 07:43 ):

Ugh, no wonder. That's enough. NBC.

Speaker 6 ( 07:49 ):

Mr. President, who has more authority? Elon Musk or the cabinet secretaries?

Donald Trump ( 07:49 ):

Any other questions about the World Cup?

Gianni ( 07:52 ):

Can we unveil the trophy maybe?

Donald Trump ( 07:54 ):

I'd love to do that.

Gianni ( 07:54 ):

Because this is something special. So today's a hundred days to go for a new competition that we created together. The FIFA Club World Cup, the best clubs in the world with the best players in the world. So we can show this is a unique trophy. This is the trophy, but it's not finished because it's unlike any other trophy. There is a key.

Donald Trump ( 08:23 ):

Oh wow.

Gianni ( 08:26 ):

There is no other sports trophy like that.

Donald Trump ( 08:28 ):

Oh, that is good. Whoa.

Gianni ( 08:29 ):

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump ( 08:32 ):

Oh, you got to be kidding.

Gianni ( 08:33 ):

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Donald Trump ( 08:44 ):

Wow.

Gianni ( 08:44 ):

Wait, wait, wait.

Donald Trump ( 08:45 ):

Wow.

Gianni ( 08:49 ):

And that's a trophy.

Donald Trump ( 08:52 ):

That is something, huh?

Ryan ( 08:53 ):

We got to win now, Mr. President.

Gianni ( 08:57 ):

So this is a good one.

Donald Trump ( 08:58 ):

That's beautiful.

Gianni ( 08:59 ):

Inter Miami and Seattle Sounders play.

Donald Trump ( 09:01 ):

Never seen anything like that.

Gianni ( 09:03 ):

It is a trophy of the future. It represents the past, the future, everything. The present.

Donald Trump ( 09:09 ):

And this will be at the White House for a little while.

Gianni ( 09:12 ):

Yes.

Donald Trump ( 09:12 ):

So if anybody needs a picture or anything, you can take it.

Gianni ( 09:16 ):

If you like it, Mr. President, it can stay here just on the 13th of July, you should take it with me.

Donald Trump ( 09:23 ):

Yeah, let's leave it here.

Gianni ( 09:24 ):

To the stadium to give it to the winners. They can take a picture. Then we bring it back here after the picture.

Donald Trump ( 09:29 ):

Let's do that. We'll leave it here. We'll have it in the White House quite a bit.

Gianni ( 09:33 ):

Excellent.

Donald Trump ( 09:33 ):

It travels a little bit also, but I appreciate it. That's good. And know this can definitely stay, right? Anyway, thank you Gianni very much.

Gianni ( 09:42 ):

Thank you so much.

Donald Trump ( 09:43 ):

Congratulations.

Gianni ( 09:45 ):

Thank you, president.

Speaker 4 ( 09:46 ):

On the cabinet meeting, sir, just on the cabinet meeting, you said Musk will play an advisory role.

Donald Trump ( 09:49 ):

We're talking about FIFA. Thank you very much.

Speaker 4 ( 09:51 ):

How about the work, Mr. President, you're having-

Donald Trump ( 09:54 ):

And they're both great guys. And by the way, they both get along fantastically well. Marco has done unbelievably as Secretary of State, and Elon is a very unique guy. He's done a fantastic job.

Speaker 4 ( 10:06 ):

Do you think he needs to be reigned in, Mr. President?

Donald Trump ( 10:09 ):

Enough. Enough. It's FIFA. Is this a FIFA question?

Speaker 4 ( 10:12 ):

How do you see the World Cup playing out with the tensions you have with Canada and Mexico?

Donald Trump ( 10:21 ):

Oh, I think it's going to make it more exciting. Tension's a good thing.

Speaker 4 ( 10:22 ):

Even for the World Cup?

Donald Trump ( 10:24 ):

Yeah, I think so. I think it makes it much more exciting.

Speaker 7 ( 10:27 ):

Sir, the entire committee is here for FIFA.

Donald Trump ( 10:31 ):

Oh, please come up.

Speaker 7 ( 10:31 ):

Would you like them to come up and take a picture?

Donald Trump ( 10:33 ):

Please. Gianni, come on. Get them up. That's great.

Speaker 8 ( 10:37 ):

Mr. President, what type of enhanced security do you anticipate having for all of these big events that are happening over the course of the next few months?

Donald Trump ( 10:47 ):

I'll let Kristi answer that question.

Kristi Noem ( 10:49 ):

Answer what question?

Donald Trump ( 10:50 ):

Go ahead. Security.

Kristi Noem ( 10:52 ):

The security for this event will be run by the Department of Homeland Security. So we are signing today this document that will say that we will form task forces and partnerships. We'll have incident command centers in these 11 cities that will partner all the agencies and departments at the federal. We'll have some worldwide partners as well as-

Gianni ( 11:14 ):

Global.

Kristi Noem ( 11:15 ):

Yes. It'll be under our umbrella and we'll help facilitate that. But also working with our local law enforcement is incredibly powerful. So streamlining those communications. It'll be a wonderful event and everybody will be safe and fun.

Donald Trump ( 11:29 ):

We better be, right?

Kristi Noem ( 11:30 ):

Yeah, it will be.

Gianni ( 11:30 ):

This is the official ball with your name.

Donald Trump ( 11:33 ):

Thank you very much.

Speaker 10 ( 11:33 ):

With your name there.

Donald Trump ( 11:36 ):

Oh, that's nice. I would give it to Kristi except it has my name on it.

Speaker 10 ( 11:39 ):

We have another one for her.

Gianni ( 11:40 ):

Of course. Of course.

Donald Trump ( 11:42 ):

That's beautiful. Thank you very much. Is that going to be the ball?

Gianni ( 11:44 ):

It's the official match ball.

Donald Trump ( 11:46 ):

This will be what it will look like, the ball?

Gianni ( 11:48 ):

Yes.

Donald Trump ( 11:49 ):

When they play?

Gianni ( 11:49 ):

When they play.

Donald Trump ( 11:50 ):

Wow. That's great.

Gianni ( 11:51 ):

Yes. Nobody played yet. Has played yet.

Donald Trump ( 11:53 ):
