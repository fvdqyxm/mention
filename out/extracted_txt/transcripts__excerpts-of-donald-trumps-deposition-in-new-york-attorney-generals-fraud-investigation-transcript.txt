Zef Kota ( 00:04 ):

Good morning. We’re going on the record at 9:38 AM Eastern Daylight Time, on August 10th, 2022. Please note that the microphones are sensitive and may pick up whispering and private conversations. Please mute your phones at this time. Audio and video recording will continue to take place unless all parties agree to go off the record. This is media unit one of the video recorded deposition of Donald J. Trump, taken by counsel in the matter of financial statements and investigation for the State of New York Office of Attorney General. The location of the deposition is 28th Liberty Street, New York, New York. My name is Zef Kota, representing, Veritext, and I am the videographer. The court reporter is Linda Greenstein, from the firm Veritext. I am not authorized to administer an oath, I am not related to any party in this action, nor am I financially interested in the outcome. Counsel and all present including those remotely have been noted for the record. Will the court reporter please swear in the witness and then counsel may proceed.

Linda Greenstein ( 01:24 ):

[inaudible 00:01:25]. Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

Donald Trump ( 01:29 ):

I do.

Linda Greenstein ( 01:29 ):

Thank you.

Letitia James ( 01:34 ):

Good morning, Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump ( 01:35 ):

Good morning.

Letitia James ( 01:36 ):

My name is Letitia James, and I’m the attorney general for the great state of New York. Before we begin, if everybody could please silence their cell phones, we would appreciate that. I wanted to begin with some preliminary rules, some ground rules if you don’t mind-

Donald Trump ( 01:48 ):

Sure.

Letitia James ( 01:48 ):

…and then I’m going to turn it over to Kevin Wallace, who will conduct this examination. Mr. Trump, you’ve testified under oath many times, is that correct?

Donald Trump ( 01:57 ):

Yes.

Letitia James ( 01:59 ):

Okay. So I take it you are familiar with the ground rules for how testimony proceeds, is that correct?

Donald Trump ( 02:03 ):

Yes.

Letitia James ( 02:04 ):

Okay. So I’ll skip that part of the introduction, is that okay?

Donald Trump ( 02:10 ):

Sure.

Letitia James ( 02:10 ):

Okay. And are you okay right now?

Donald Trump ( 02:12 ):

I am. Thanks.

Letitia James ( 02:12 ):

Okay. Good, good, good. What I will do is explain some differences between the procedures and the civil deposition and the testimony we are taking today. Because this is an investigatory proceeding. You do not have a right to have an attorney with you in this investigation, but I have agreed that your attorney will be present today. However, this examination is not the same as a deposition in ordinary civil litigation, and your attorney’s role will be limited to consultation with you, in order to give you legal advice regarding privileged matters, if any, or your right not to incriminate yourself. Not withstanding any objection by your attorneys, you are still required to respond to any questions unless your attorney specifically directs you not to answer. Anything you say in this examination may be used in a civil proceeding, and that could include a civil enforcement proceeding or a criminal action. Do you understand that?

Donald Trump ( 03:10 ):

I think.

Letitia James ( 03:10 ):

Okay. Is that a yes?

Donald Trump ( 03:15 ):

I don’t know what I did wrong, but the answer is yes, I do understand.

Letitia James ( 03:19 ):

Okay. Thank you. You have the right to refuse to answer any question if a truthful answer to the question would tend to incriminate you. Do you understand that?

Donald Trump ( 03:27 ):

Yes.

Letitia James ( 03:27 ):

Okay. And any willful misstatement by you may constitute perjury. Do you understand that, sir?

Donald Trump ( 03:34 ):

Yes.

Letitia James ( 03:35 ):

Okay. Finally, this investigation is confidential. We request that you not discuss this matter, your testimony here today, and any documents that you have produced or may produce in connection with today’s testimony with anyone other than your attorneys. Do you understand that, sir?

Donald Trump ( 03:54 ):

No. When you say confidential, we’re not allowed to talk about this to the press or?

Letitia James ( 04:00 ):

Correct.

Donald Trump ( 04:03 ):

Oh.

Speaker 1 ( 04:03 ):

I believe, she means the details of what happened in this room, obviously-

Donald Trump ( 04:08 ):

It’s okay. It’s okay with me.

Letitia James ( 04:08 ):

The fact that it happened, yes, but not the details.

Donald Trump ( 04:14 ):

Okay.

Letitia James ( 04:15 ):

Neither you nor anyone acting on your behalf has the right to obtain a copy of the transcript of your testimony here today from the reporter. And neither you nor Veritext are permitted to release copies of the transcript to anyone other than representatives of this office, the Office of the Attorney General. Extensive note-taking or any attempt to create a transcript of the proceedings here by you or your attorney is not authorized, and will not be permitted. Are you taking any medication or drugs of any kind that make it difficult for you to understand or answer any of the questions today, sir?

Donald Trump ( 04:58 ):

No. I had aspirin.

Letitia James ( 04:58 ):

And are you feeling okay today?

Donald Trump ( 04:59 ):

Yes.

Letitia James ( 04:59 ):

And are you sick today?

Donald Trump ( 05:01 ):

No.

Letitia James ( 05:03 ):

Okay. And do you have any conditions that could prevent you from giving full, complete, and truthful answers to any questions today?

Donald Trump ( 05:13 ):

No.

Letitia James ( 05:13 ):

Okay. And is there any other reason why you cannot give full, complete, and accurate testimony here today?

Donald Trump ( 05:23 ):

Well, I’ll be doing this…

Speaker 1 ( 05:23 ):

No.

Donald Trump ( 05:27 ):

No, other than what I’m saying.

Letitia James ( 05:28 ):

Okay. I’m now going to turn it over to Kevin Wallace. Thank you, sir.

Donald Trump ( 05:33 ):

Thank you very much.

Kevin Wallace ( 05:34 ):

Good morning, Mr. Trump.

Donald Trump ( 05:35 ):

Good morning.

Kevin Wallace ( 05:36 ):

As the attorney general mentioned, my name is Kevin Wallace. Sitting next to me is Alex Finkelstein from our office, and sitting next to him is Samantha Stern, who’s a paralegal with our office, they’re going to be assisting me during the day today. I’m going to take a moment just to correct one thing from the read in, is that we go off the record, not when both parties agree, but when the attorney general directs that we are off the record. During these proceedings, the attorney general controls the record. So, Mr. Trump, what did you do to prepare for today’s examination?

Speaker 1 ( 06:10 ):

You can read your statement.

Donald Trump ( 06:12 ):

Very little.

Speaker 1 ( 06:13 ):

Read your statement.

Donald Trump ( 06:15 ):

If you’d like, I could read the statement. But very little.

Kevin Wallace ( 06:18 ):

Well…

Speaker 1 ( 06:21 ):

Read the statement.

Speaker 2 ( 06:21 ):

Excuse me?

Speaker 1 ( 06:21 ):

Read the statement.

Kevin Wallace ( 06:21 ):

Can we go…

Speaker 1 ( 06:21 ):

Yes, he would like to-

Kevin Wallace ( 06:23 ):

I will now use my moment to go off the record.

Speaker 1 ( 06:26 ):

Thank you. Sorry, just read the statement.

Zef Kota ( 06:28 ):

We’re going off the record at 9:44 AM.

( 06:36 ) We’re back on the record at 9:45 AM.

Kevin Wallace ( 06:40 ):

Mr. Trump, I understand you have a statement that you wanted to read into the record.

Donald Trump ( 06:43 ):

Yes.

Kevin Wallace ( 06:45 ):

Would you please, feel free to start at any time.

Donald Trump ( 06:47 ):

Thank you very much.

( 06:50 ) This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. There has never been another president, or perhaps even another politician, who has been persecuted, harassed, and in every other way unfairly treated like President Donald J. Trump. What Letitia James has tried to do the last number of years is a disgrace to the legal system, and affront to the New York State taxpayers, and a violation of the solemn rights and protections afforded by the United States Constitution. She developed a political platform and made a career out of maliciously attacking me and my business, before she even understood, or was elected, or reviewed one of the millions of pages of documents we willingly produced. We willingly produced these documents. James proclaimed that she, “Looks forward to going into the office of attorney general every day, suing me and then going home.” This is during her campaign. She announced that she was obsessed with, “Taking me on.” Taking me on… And that her eyes were set on Trump Tower, “Trump Tower.”

( 08:20 ) She even assured her supporters as an election promise, very strongly that, “We’re going to definitely sue him…” Before she even knew anything about me. “We’re going to be a real pain in his ass. He’s going to know my name personally.” And she claimed I was on an illegitimate, and that it was an illegitimate president, “Illegitimate president.” In her AG speech, she promised to, “Shine a bright light into every dark corner of Trump’s real estate holdings.” Shortly thereafter, she vowed to, “Use every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family as well.”

( 09:11 ) She knows nothing about us. This is when she knew absolutely nothing about us, it was very unfair. This whole thing is very unfair. As a pretense for commencing her bogus investigation, Letitia James relied on the testimony of Michael Cohen, a convicted felon and liar. The Southern District of New York astutely described Cohen as a man who, “Repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends,” by engaging in, “Extensive, deliberate, and serious criminal conduct,” consistent with a, “Pattern of deception that permeated his professional life.” This was in a long many page statement by him.

Donald Trump ( 10:01 ):

It only gets worse. This is the witness, a stone called loser, a real loser that she used to justify her obsessive work, her obsessive investigation of me, even though he got in civil and criminal trouble for representing himself on a taxi cab company that he had and other things, and also others as a lawyer. I once asked, “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?” I was asking that question. Now I know the answer to that question. When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated witch hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and even the fake news media, you really have no choice.

( 11:06 ) We cannot permit a renegade and out of control prosecutor to use this investigation as a means of advancing her political career. New York deserves better and this country deserves better. Being a prosecutor is a very important thing. This is a vindictive and self-serving fishing expedition, the likes of which this country has perhaps never seen before. If there was any question in my mind, the raid in my home two days ago, Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach, Florida by the FBI just two days prior to this deposition, think of it, wiped out any of that uncertainty. I have absolutely no choice because the current administration and many prosecutors in this country have lost all moral and ethical bounds of decency. Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool.

( 12:12 ) One statement or answer that is ever so slightly off, just ever so slightly, by accident, by mistake, such as it was a sunny, beautiful day, when actually it was slightly overcast, would be met by law enforcement at a level seldom scene in this country, because I’ve experienced it. The United States Constitution exists for this very purpose, and I will utilize it to the fullest extent and defend myself against this malicious attack by this administration, this attorney general’s office, and all other attacks on my family, my business, and our country. Accordingly under the advice of my council and for all of the above reasons, I respectfully decline to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution. This will be my answer to any further questions.

Kevin Wallace ( 13:24 ):

Include among the rights and privileges afforded every citizen under the United States Constitution, does that include the Fifth Amendment right to avoid incrimination?

Speaker 3 ( 13:33 ):

Yeah.

Kevin Wallace ( 13:33 ):

Is that your counsel?

Donald Trump ( 13:35 ):

Yes.

Kevin Wallace ( 13:35 ):

Okay. Okay. I will just note for the record, that was a lengthy statement. Obviously, we disagree with all of the characterizations, but to keep today’s proceedings moving, I’m going to move on to my questioning. So Mr. Trump, I take it you are not going to answer any questions about your preparation today with your counsel. Is that correct?

Speaker 3 ( 13:59 ):

Just read that.

Donald Trump ( 14:03 ):

Should I say this or should I respond to that?

Speaker 3 ( 14:06 ):

Just read that.

Donald Trump ( 14:08 ):

For all of the reasons provided in my answer, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, I decline to answer the question.

Kevin Wallace ( 14:17 ):

Okay. Mr. Trump, the focus of our investigation and what we are primarily going to cover today involves the presentation of your statements of financial condition between 2011 and the present. I take it you are generally familiar with those statements. Is that correct?

Donald Trump ( 14:33 ):

For all of the reasons provided in my answer, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, I decline to answer the question.

Kevin Wallace ( 14:48 ):

Okay. Did you review any of those statements from the period 2011 to 2021 during your preparation for today’s testimony?

Donald Trump ( 14:57 ):

For all of the reasons provided in my answer, which is incorporated here in its entirety, I just decline to answer the question.

Kevin Wallace ( 15:06 ):

Counsel, I think we can all stipulate that if he says same answer, we will all understand it to-

Donald Trump ( 15:10 ):

Right.

Kevin Wallace ( 15:10 ):

… be the same invocation-

Speaker 4 ( 15:11 ):

That’s correct.

Kevin Wallace ( 15:12 ):

… to speed things up. Okay.

Speaker 3 ( 15:13 ):

No problem.

Kevin Wallace ( 15:13 ):

With that note, sir, you’re currently the president of the Trump organization. Is that correct?

Donald Trump ( 15:20 ):

Same answer.

Kevin Wallace ( 15:21 ):

And when I refer to the Trump organization, is it accurate to describe that as the trade name for an umbrella organization that holds assets beneficially owned by you?

Donald Trump ( 15:32 ):

Same answer.

Kevin Wallace ( 15:34 ):

Is it fair to say that the Trump organization sits on top of several hundred different legal entities?

Donald Trump ( 15:40 ):

Same answer.

Are the assets of the Trump organization currently held in irrevocable trust?

Donald Trump ( 15:47 ):

Is that revocable trust the Donald J. Trump revocable trust dated April 7th, 2014?

Donald Trump ( 15:57 ):

And you are the donor of the assets in that trust. Is that correct?

And you are the sole beneficiary of the assets in that trust, is that correct?

Why did you form that trust in April, 2014?

Donald Trump ( 16:14 ):

Same answer.

Kevin Wallace ( 16:16 ):

Who were the trustees when the trust was first founded?

Donald Trump ( 16:20 ):

Same answer.

Kevin Wallace ( 16:22 ):

Donald Trump ( 16:28 ):

Same answer.

Did you ever consider retaining independent trustees to oversee the trust?

Donald Trump ( 16:34 ):

Same answer.

Kevin Wallace ( 16:37 ):

At present, your son, Don Jr, is the sole trustee. Is that correct?

Donald Trump ( 16:41 ):

Same answer.

( 16:44 ) Okay.

Speaker 3 ( 16:48 ):

Thank you.

Kevin Wallace ( 16:54 ):
