Alice Barr ( 00:17 ):

In the final hours before tonight’s highly anticipated face off, President Biden and former President Trump fine-tuning their talking points.

( 00:26 ) The former president’s likely centered on immigration and the economy, previewed in a call-in to a campaign event with Black businessmen.

Donald Trump ( 00:34 ):

Inflation is a disaster. It’s killing the Black community and it’s killing the country.

Alice Barr ( 00:41 ):

President Biden expected to focus on reproductive rights and threats to democracy, both candidates hoping to break through with voters who are skeptical of both: so-called double haters making up nearly a quarter of the electorate.

Speaker 4 ( 00:53 ):

I’m undecided on both of them because I don’t really like what they’re talking about doing.

Alice Barr ( 01:00 ):

The debate offers a potential pivot point with a new poll finding six in 10 Americans plan to watch.

Speaker 5 ( 01:06 ):

For a lot of these undecided voters, Biden and Trump are the same old, same old. They want to hear something new.

Alice Barr ( 01:12 ):

To ensure voters can hear where the two men stand on the issues, mics will be muted while the other candidate is speaking, and there will be no live studio audience; something the Trump campaign agreed to, but the former president now complains will mean a sterile, dead room; the Biden campaign setting up a war room to blast out fact checks during the 90 minute primetime showdown.

( 01:35 ) The Biden campaign also launching a digital strategy, working with high profile social media content creators to ensure clips that they want shared from the debate get posted far and wide.

( 01:48 ) Coming out of the debate, both candidates will be on the campaign trail; President Biden planning a rally in North Carolina, former President Trump, one in Virginia.
