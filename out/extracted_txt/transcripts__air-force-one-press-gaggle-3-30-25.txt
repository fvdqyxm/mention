Reporter 1 ( 00:00 ):

Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 00:02 ):

I hope you had a good time this weekend. We had a lot of very interesting things happen. I think we're making a lot of progress on Ukraine and Russia. There's always conflict, but I think we're making a lot of progress getting it stopped. We just want to see thousands of soldiers a week stop dying. Because they're dying at numbers that probably we haven't seen since the Second World War, for no reason whatsoever. It's a shame. It's a shame. I think we are making progress. It's step by step. There's tremendous hatred between the leaders, if you call the whole situation leaders. But I think we'll get that done. And the Middle East, a lot of things are happening with respect to Iran and we'll see if we can get something done. And if not, it's going to be a bad situation. Very, very bad.

Reporter 2 ( 01:02 ):

On these Oil sanctions that you mentioned today, when will they start?

Donald Trump ( 01:11 ):

We have a couple. We have the secondary tariffs on Iran and we'll probably give it a couple of weeks and, if we don't see any progress, we're going to put them on. We're not putting them on right now. But if you remember, I did that six years ago and it worked very well, to put it mildly. And if the election weren't rigged, you would have a situation where there would be no problem with Iran today. But it was. Biden didn't know what he was doing, obviously, and we have a very rough situation in the Middle East because of that. You ended up with October 7th and you would've never had October 7th and you would've never had Russia going into Ukraine, likewise.

( 01:55 ) But we're going to make a decision on secondary tariffs on Iran based on whether or not they're going to make a deal. If they're going to make a deal, then we're never going to put secondary tariffs on. We're going to hope that they have a great long and successful life as a country, but we'll see what happens. It's very interesting. I can't imagine them doing anything else but making a deal. I would prefer a deal to the other alternative, which I think everybody in this plane knows what that is, and that's not going to be pretty, and I do not prefer that.

Reporter 3 ( 02:33 ):

Mr. President-

Reporter 4 ( 02:33 ):

[inaudible 00:02:34].

Reporter 3 ( 02:34 ):

Mr. President, on the tariffs, you said, at one point, that the tariffs Tuesday would be more conservative than what people might think. There's reports that you are maybe now looking to make the tariffs higher. Are you weighing higher tariffs?

Donald Trump ( 02:49 ):

No. The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America over the decades. They ripped us off like no country's ever been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us, but it's substantial money for the country, nevertheless.

Reporter 1 ( 03:15 ):

Mr. President-

Reporter 5 ( 03:16 ):

Mr. President. On the tariffs that you're planning, you're expecting to hit something like 10 to 15 countries, is that right?

Donald Trump ( 03:27 ):

No. No.

Reporter 1 ( 03:27 ):

All countries?

Reporter 3 ( 03:27 ):

All of the countries?

Reporter 5 ( 03:27 ):

Is it across the board?

Donald Trump ( 03:28 ):

Not 10. I don't know who told you 10 or 15 countries.

Reporter 5 ( 03:32 ):

We heard that. We heard that you were going to hit aim for the-

Reporter 1 ( 03:33 ):

15%.

Donald Trump ( 03:33 ):

But you didn't hear it from me.

Reporter 5 ( 03:33 ):

Okay. How many countries will be in that initial tranche?

Donald Trump ( 03:39 ):

You'd start with all countries, so let's see what happens. There are many countries.

Reporter 5 ( 03:44 ):

How about in Russia?

Donald Trump ( 03:45 ):

I haven't heard a rumor about 10 or 15 countries.

Reporter 1 ( 03:49 ):

You're starting with all countries?

Donald Trump ( 03:50 ):

Essentially, all of the countries that we're talking about. Wouldn't be talking about all countries, that's not a cutoff. And if you look at the history and you look at what's happened to us, you go to certain places, go to Asia, and you take a look at every single country in Asia, what they've done to the United States in trade. And by the way, in military, in a certain way. But take a look at trade with Asia. I wouldn't say anybody is treated as fairly or nicely, but we're going to be much more generous to them in terms of heart. We're going to be much more generous than they were to us.

Reporter 2 ( 04:34 ):

You said you were not joking about a third term, about possibly wanting a third term. Does that mean you're not planning to leave office on January 20th?

Donald Trump ( 04:44 ):

I'm not looking at that, but I'll tell you, I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which is, in a way it's fourth term because the 2020 election was totally rigged. It's actually sort of a fourth term, in a certain way. I just don't want the credit for the second because Biden was so bad. He did such a bad job. And I think that's one of the reasons that I'm popular, if you want to know the truth. I think I'm popular because we've done a great job. I think we've had the best almost 100 days of any president and most people are saying that. And it's an honor.

( 05:18 ) We're bringing back our country. We're respected as a country again and we're strongly respected and people are amazed. I was with some very important people today and they said that they've never seen a turnaround of a country as fast as this. Even look at our border. We have nobody coming in. And you can come into our country, but you have to come in legally. But we have nobody coming in to our country. It's almost shut down. They've never seen anything like this.

Reporter 5 ( 05:47 ):

The constitution… Mr. President-

Reporter 2 ( 05:48 ):

Is that an appropriate precedent?

Reporter 5 ( 05:51 ):

The constitution limits a president to two terms. Is it your understanding that they have to be-

Donald Trump ( 05:55 ):

I don't even want to talk about it. I'm just telling you, I have had more people say please run again. I said, we have a long way to go before we even think about that.

Reporter 2 ( 06:04 ):

Can I ask a question over here?

Donald Trump ( 06:04 ):

But I've had a lot of people… Yeah, go. Did you have something?

Reporter 2 ( 06:06 ):

Yeah, I just wanted to ask, do you think that's an appropriate precedent to set, even if it wasn't you in this position, to see a president serve a third term?

Donald Trump ( 06:17 ):

I don't want to talk about a third term now because, no matter how you look at it, we got a long time to go. We have a long time. We have almost four years to go. And that's a long time. But despite that, so many people are saying, you've got to run again. They love the job window. Most importantly, they love the job window.

Reporter 5 ( 06:37 ):

Are you saying-

Reporter 4 ( 06:37 ):

You said you were upset with Putin.

Reporter 5 ( 06:37 ):

I just want to clarify-

Reporter 4 ( 06:38 ):

Would you say your relationship with Vladimir Putin is at its lowest point right now?

Donald Trump ( 06:43 ):

No, I don't think so. I don't think he's going to go back on his word. You're talking about Putin. I don't think he's going to go back on his work. I've known him for a long time. We've always gotten along well despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. It's a hoax created by Clinton and Schiff and all of these lunatics. And that really was a dangerous point. That was a very dangerous thing they did to this country. It was a pure unadulterated scam, hoax.

( 07:14 ) But no, I think he'll be okay. But if he isn't… I was disappointed in a certain way, some of the things that were said over the last day or two having to do with Zelenskyy, because when he considers Zelenskyy not credible, he's supposed to be making a deal with him. Whether you like him or you don't like him. I wasn't happy with that, but I think he's going to be good. And I certainly wouldn't want to put secondary tariffs on Russia, but if they were put on, it would not be very good for them.

Reporter 2 ( 07:45 ):

Mr. President-

Donald Trump ( 07:47 ):

We put secondary tariffs on, as you know, in Venezuela and it's had a very strong impact on Venezuela. You know that every ship just got out and that they left. A lot of them left. They dropped the hoses right into the ocean and they left. They didn't want to be there for a minute because they didn't want those tariffs to catch on, or they didn't want me to see them there. The Venezuela secondary tariffs… All secondary tariffs are very strong because, essentially, it says, if you disobey our orders, you cannot do business in the United States of America. And that's the cash cow.

Reporter 3 ( 08:24 ):

Would that invite Chinese companies buying Russian oil as well, if you plan to go ahead with those?

Donald Trump ( 08:28 ):

In the case of Venezuela, as you know, China pulled up anchor and left. They were there. They had two ships there and they left empty. They didn't want to take a chance. No, we're not playing games. Okay. Any other questions?

Reporter 1 ( 08:42 ):

Sir, will you clarify. Are you planning to leave office January 20th, 2029 or are you saying you might not?

Donald Trump ( 08:49 ):

Go ahead. Any other questions?

Reporter 5 ( 08:50 ):

TikTok. On TikTok. A deadline's coming up.

Donald Trump ( 08:54 ):

TikTok, we have a lot of potential buyers. There's tremendous interest in TikTok. The decision's going to be my decision, as you know, through Congress. They've given me the power to make the decision. We have a great team of people essentially taking bids. We have a lot of people that want to buy TikTok. We're dealing with China also on it because they may have something to do with it. And we'll see how that goes. But it's something I think you're going to have… I'd like to see TikTok remain alive. I'll be honest. Selfishly speaking, I won the young vote by 36 points. Republicans generally don't do very well with the young vote. And I think a lot of it could have been TikTok, it could have been Joe Rogan and it could have been a lot of things, but it was also TikTok. TikTok is… It's very interesting. A lot of people want to buy it.

Reporter 2 ( 09:50 ):

If no deal, will you extend the deadline?

Donald Trump ( 09:52 ):

There'll be a deal with TikTok. I'm pretty sure.

Reporter 4 ( 09:54 ):

Sir. On the border-

Donald Trump ( 09:55 ):

We would, we would.

Reporter 5 ( 09:55 ):

Mr. President-

Reporter 2 ( 10:00 ):

Is there a deadline for Russian president, Vladimir Putin? Is there a deadline for Russian president Vladimir Putin to agree to ceasefire?

Donald Trump ( 10:03 ):

It's a psychological deadline. If I think they're tapping us along, I will not be happy about it.

Reporter 2 ( 10:11 ):

Do you think they are right now?

Donald Trump ( 10:12 ):

I don't know. I don't know. I don't think so. I think he wants to make a deal. And I think Zelenskyy, by the way, I see he's trying to back out of the rare earth deal. And if he does that, he's got some problems. Big, big problems.

Reporter 1 ( 10:26 ):

Is it harder-

Donald Trump ( 10:27 ):

We made a deal on rare Earth and now he's saying, "I want to renegotiate the deal." He wants to be a member of NATO. He was never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that. If he's looking to renegotiate the deal, he's got big problems. Go ahead.

Reporter 2 ( 10:44 ):

Mr. President, have you had any more outreach from the automakers and are you reconsidering that at all?

Donald Trump ( 10:50 ):

No. The automakers are going to make a lot of money. The American automakers, or international automakers, if you're talking about they're going to build in the United States. The people that are going to make money are people that manufacture cars in the United States. Outside of the United States, that's going to be up to them. I don't care too much about that. But you have a lot of companies coming into the country to manufacture cars.

( 11:20 ) As you know, the Autoworkers Union, I did great. I won Michigan by a lot. But the Autoworkers Union, they were fantastic to me. But now they're really fantastic. And even Shawn Fain, who I don't know, but he obviously wasn't a supporter of mine, he's a Democrat. He said wonderful things about Donald Trump. He said, "I can't believe this is finally happening." The people that manufacture automobiles in the United States are going to make money the likes of which they've never seen before. But beyond that, we have the computer companies, the chip companies, the pharmaceutical companies. We have lumber. We have everything. Steel. They're all going to do really well as long as they do their product in the United States. Thank you very much, everybody.

Reporter 4 ( 12:06 ):

On the border-

Reporter 1 ( 12:07 ):

Mr. President, just one last question about stagflation now. Is that something that you're worried about given the impact of your efforts to readjust the economies?

Donald Trump ( 12:14 ):

I haven't heard that term in years. I don't know anything about it. This country is going to be more successful than it ever was. It's going to boom. We're going to have boom town USA. We're going to boom. And many industries. And we're going to bring manufacturing and we're going to bring product. For instance, we need pharmaceuticals in a company. We don't want to be buying our pharmaceuticals from other countries because, if we're in a war or we're in a problem, we want to be able to make our own. We have our own lumber. We have our own energy. We don't need energy from Canada. We don't need lumber from Canada. We don't need anything from Canada. We don't need cars from Canada, as an example. I think we're going to have, I call it, the golden age of America. I believe this will be the golden age of America. Thank you very much, everybody.
