President Trump ( 00:00 ):

That was a great trip to a fantastic place, the Commonwealth, Pennsylvania. The steelworkers are very happy. We did the tariffs. It's going to make them even more competitive. And it's turning out to be a great deal. I think it's going to be a fantastic deal. $17 billion is being invested for new steel mills, new everything. And it's going to be something special. That was in honor of the steelworkers of Pennsylvania. And it was a fantastic time. We had a great day. And it is raining quite hard, but that's okay. How are you? Go ahead.

Interviewer ( 00:38 ):

Yes, sir. Can you make Pennsylvania the steel capital of the world again?

President Trump ( 00:41 ):

I think that's going to happen. I think it's going to happen.

Interviewer ( 00:43 ):

You've just given them…

President Trump ( 00:44 ):

Not much. We just had $17 billion given. And again, we're going to have control in the U.S. It's going to be a USA deal, the border's control. More importantly, the money's built… It's spent on facilities. You can't take them and leave and, "Let's put them in a boat." Somebody said, "Well, what about that?" Supposing they leave. Well, the money is invested on brick and mortar. You can't lift it up and take it. But I think, much more importantly, that's going to be a great partnership. And the company, Nippon, is coming in with $17 billion-plus. So it's going to be fantastic for all steelworkers.

Interviewer ( 01:23 ):

Is it an acquisition? Is Nippon acquiring U.S. steel?

President Trump ( 01:23 ):

This is an investment. It's controlled by the United States. And more importantly, they're spending the money on brick and mortar. You can't take it. What are you going to do? Pick it up and move it to Japan? That's not going to happen.

Interviewer ( 01:35 ):

But they will own U.S. steel?

President Trump ( 01:36 ):

I rejected this about four times now. And when they finally got it right, I liked it a lot. And you can see how happy the steelworkers were. More importantly, you can see, from the union standpoint, the union loved it.

Interviewer ( 01:49 ):

It means thousands of jobs in Pennsylvania, right?

President Trump ( 01:54 ):

Many thousands of jobs.

Interviewer ( 01:57 ):

The State of Pennsylvania was more worthy.

President Trump ( 01:57 ):

I like this man.

Interviewer ( 01:58 ):

Mr. President, were you aware of Elon Musk's regular drug use?

President Trump ( 02:04 ):

No, I wasn't. I think he's fantastic. I think Elon is a fantastic guy.

Interviewer ( 02:08 ):

Are you troubled by these reports?

President Trump ( 02:11 ):

I'm not troubled by anything with Elon. I think he's fantastic. Did a great job. And Doge continues. And by the time it's finished, we'll have numbers that will knock your socks off. He did a fantastic job. And he didn't need it. He didn't need to do it.

Interviewer ( 02:26 ):

Is steel deal final? Has it been finalized?

President Trump ( 02:26 ):

He's not easily replaced. Steel deal, yes?

Interviewer ( 02:26 ):

Has the U.S. Steel deal been finalized and signed off on?

President Trump ( 02:36 ):

No, I have to approve the final deal.

Interviewer ( 02:37 ):

Well, how will it stay in U.S. ownership, in the U.S.?

President Trump ( 02:40 ):

Well, you'll see, but I have to approve the final deal with Nippon. And we haven't seen that final deal yet. But they've made a very big commitment. And it's a very big investment. It's the largest investment in the history of the State of Pennsylvania in any deal, not just steel. And it's thousands of steel workers. And not only there, all throughout the country.

Interviewer ( 03:03 ):

Mr. President, do you support the Lindsey Graham Blumenthal Bill that would levy sanctions on Russia?

President Trump ( 03:11 ):

I don't know. I have to see it. I'll take a look at it.

Interviewer ( 03:13 ):

Are you confident that your proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, that was just submitted this week, will get approved by Hamas?

President Trump ( 03:21 ):

I think they want to get out of that mess. They're in a big mess. I think they want to get out of it.

Interviewer ( 03:27 ):

Should we anticipate any trade deals next week at all? And does this deal today with Nippon sort of overall help your talks with Japan?

President Trump ( 03:37 ):

Well, Japan very much wants to make a trade deal. I don't think this has much to do with it, but it certainly won't hurt because we have a very good relationship with Japan. But as you know, Japan is in there right now negotiating as we speak. And they want to very much make a deal.

( 03:53 ) I think the deal I'm most proud of is the fact that we're dealing with India, we're dealing with Pakistan, and we're able to stop potentially a nuclear war through trade, as opposed to through bullets. Normally, they do it through bullets. We do it through trade. So, I'm very proud of that. Nobody talks about it, but we had a very nasty potential war going on between Pakistan and India. And now, if you look, they're doing fine. It was getting very bad. It was getting very nasty. They're both nuclear powers. The Pakistan representatives are coming in next week. And India, as you know, we're very close to making a deal with India. And I wouldn't have any interest in making a deal with either if they were going to be at war with each other. I would not, and I'd let them know.

Interviewer ( 04:43 ):

You're messaging the G7 here in two weeks. You're going to Canada. Mark Carney up there has a different view of the world than you do-

President Trump ( 04:48 ):

He does.

Interviewer ( 04:48 ):

… when it comes to energy, clearly. What's your message going to be at G7 here in a couple of weeks?

President Trump ( 04:55 ):

Well, it's in Canada. And he's a very nice guy, by the way, Mark Carney. I think he's really a very nice person. And we've had some good talks. We'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.

Interviewer ( 05:03 ):

Sir, are you aware of the reports that Susie Wiles' phone has been breached and somebody's been impersonating her?

President Trump ( 05:08 ):

I've heard that, yeah.

Interviewer ( 05:09 ):

Are you concerned about that? Do you know anything about that?

President Trump ( 05:10 ):

No. She's an amazing woman. She can handle it. But I've heard that they breached her phone to her. They tried to impersonate her. Nobody can impersonate Susie. Nobody. There's only one Susie.

Interviewer ( 05:25 ):

Mr. President, what's your message to Chinese college students in the United States that want to stay in the United States, don't want their visa revoked?

President Trump ( 05:34 ):

Well, they're going to be okay. It's going to work out fine. We just want to check out the individual students. And that's true of all colleges. And I don't know why Harvard's not giving us the list. There's something going on because Harvard's not giving us the list. They ought to give us the list and get themselves out of trouble, but they don't want to give the list because they have names on there that supposedly are quite bad. We want people that can love our country and take care of our country and cherish our country. And for some reason, Harvard doesn't want to give us the list. I would suggest you all get out of the rain now. Goodbye, everybody. Have a good time. Thank you. Come here.

Interviewer ( 06:04 ):

Thank you.

President Trump ( 06:05 ):

Who are you with?

Interviewer ( 06:05 ):
