President Xi ( 00:00 ):

… and I would just like to say that it looks very bright and beautiful. It has the dignity of America and it symbolizes the new future and prosperity of America.

Speaker 1 ( 00:11 ):

[foreign language 00:00:14].

President Xi ( 00:35 ):

I believe that making America great again is your goal, and I believe that that is what is currently taking place in America. I think the most symbolic thing of that is the Dow Jones Index which reached a record high recently, although it went down a bit, but it reached a record high. I think that America is becoming great again.

Speaker 1 ( 01:03 ):

[foreign language 00:01:04].

President Xi ( 01:06 ):

I believe that there is a renaissance taking place not only in the shipbuilding sector, but also in the manufacturing industry. I hope that Korea can be a part of that renaissance.

Speaker 1 ( 01:16 ):

[foreign language 00:01:18].

President Xi ( 01:17 ):

One thing that I wanted to say to you is that America's role not as a keeper of peace, but a maker of peace is emerging more evidently.

Speaker 1 ( 01:46 ):

[foreign language 00:01:50].

President Xi ( 01:59 ):

Many wars in Europe, in Asia, in Africa, and in the Middle East are coming to peace because of the role that you are playing.

Speaker 1 ( 02:07 ):

[foreign language 00:02:10].

President Xi ( 02:17 ):

Among the many world leaders, I believe that you are the only leader who has made such accomplishments.

Speaker 1 ( 02:23 ):

[foreign language 00:02:30].

President Xi ( 02:48 ):

And I would like to mention that the only remaining divided nation in the world is the Korean Peninsula. I would like to ask for your role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula, so I look forward to your meeting with Chairman Kim Jong Un, and construction of Trump Tower in North Korea, and playing golf at that place.

Speaker 1 ( 03:11 ):

[foreign language 00:03:13].

President Xi ( 03:16 ):

I believe he will be waiting for you.

Speaker 1 ( 03:29 ):

[foreign language 00:03:30].

President Xi ( 03:38 ):

Korea was able to obtain economic growth and development through our ironclad alliance. Going forward, I hope to develop our alliance into a future-oriented alliance that encompasses areas not only limited to security, but also the economy, and science and technology.

Speaker 1 ( 03:54 ):

[foreign language 00:03:56].

President Xi ( 04:03 ):

The Korean people have great expectations for you, Mr. President. Thank you once again for your time.

President Donald Trump ( 04:08 ):

Well, thank you very much. It's an honor to be with you. I will say that Kim Jong Un and I had a very good relationship, as you remember, and still do. When I came in, I didn't know him, we had two summits, but we became very friendly. Respect, it was great respect. It was not going to be that way had Hilary Clinton won the election. It would have been a disaster. But we think we can do something in that regard, with respect to North and South. I think you are much more prone to doing that than other leaders that I've been working with from South Korea. We'll work on that. I think it's very good to work on that.

( 04:50 ) If you remember, you were doing the Olympics and there was a great time of hostility with North Korea. You weren't selling tickets because nobody wanted to be blown up in the stadium during the opening ceremonies. You were not selling tickets. I was also at my formative stage with North Korea and Kim Jong Un, and we were a little bit going at it about Rocket Man, Little Rocket Man, back and forth, and it was really nasty. Then I got a call one day, and they wanted to get together, they wanted to talk, and we started talking. He said really brilliantly. He said, "You know, the Olympics is going to be opening very soon and we'd like to be a part of it," they actually put teams in it. You got along great.

( 05:37 ) By the way, immediately upon that phone call, you started selling tickets and it turned out to be a tremendous success. It went from being empty stadiums because people were afraid to go because it was a target potentially to a great success. I was very proud of that. You had one of the most successful Olympics, and now we have the Olympics coming to the US. We're very happy about that. That was a great honor to get involved in making Olympics so successful.

Speaker 2 ( 06:03 ):

[foreign language 00:06:06].

Speaker 1 ( 06:03 ):

[foreign language 00:07:37].

President Xi ( 08:04 ):

Mr. President, you mentioned about Chairman Kim. Thanks to your efforts when you were in office during your first term, the situation on the Korean Peninsula was stable. But during the short hiatus where you were out of office, North Korea developed further its nuclear and missile capabilities, and that led to a deterioration on the situation of the Korean Peninsula.

President Donald Trump ( 08:27 ):

They wouldn't have done that. They would not have done that if I were president. That was not going to happen.

Speaker 2 ( 08:31 ):

[foreign language 00:08:36].

Speaker 1 ( 08:31 ):

[foreign language 00:08:38].

President Xi ( 08:39 ):

I completely agree with you.

Speaker 1 ( 08:40 ):

[foreign language 00:08:45].

President Xi ( 08:57 ):

When Kim Yo Jong, the deputy director of the Worker's Party of Korea, issued a statement announcing Korea, South Korea, she mentioned about the not bad relationship between you and Chairman Kim Jong Un. I believe that this is a sign that your period is waiting.

Speaker 1 ( 09:15 ):

[foreign language 00:09:17].

President Xi ( 09:20 ):

I hope that you will usher in a new era of peace on the Korean Peninsula.

President Donald Trump ( 09:25 ):

I will do that and will have talks. He'd like to meet with me. He didn't want to meet with Biden because he had no respect for Biden. But we look forward to meeting with him and we'll make relations better. You'll help that. You had a lot of leaders, I've got through a lot of leaders in South Korea, it's been quick. You'll be there for a long time. In the various leaders that I've dealt with, they were not approaching it properly in my opinion, having to do with North Korea. But I think your approach is a much better one.

Speaker 2 ( 09:59 ):

[foreign language 00:10:02].

Speaker 1 ( 09:59 ):

[foreign language 00:10:09].

President Xi ( 10:09 ):

Resolving this issue through my engagement is not an easy thing. The only person that can make progress on this issue is you, Mr. President.

Speaker 1 ( 10:49 ):

[foreign language 00:10:52].

President Xi ( 10:54 ):

If you become the peacemaker, then I will assist you by being a pacemaker.

President Donald Trump ( 11:01 ):

That's good. We can do big progress I think with North Korea absolutely.

Speaker 2 ( 11:05 ):

[foreign language 00:11:08].

Speaker 1 ( 11:05 ):

[foreign language 00:11:12].

President Donald Trump ( 11:11 ):

Hey, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Good job.

( 11:17 ) Okay, questions please?

Speaker 3 ( 11:18 ):

Mr. President, when you met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, how soon did he say that he wanted to sit down with Ukrainian President Zelensky? Russia as of now says there's no meeting on the books and no agenda is set.

President Donald Trump ( 11:29 ):

Well, that's going to be up to them. It takes to two tango, I always say it. They should meet I think before I have a meeting and probably close the deal. I think it's appropriate they meet. They do not exactly get along well, as you can understand. I'm sure it's a meeting that perhaps he didn't like, but he wasn't happy about coming to the United States either. That was a big concession and I appreciate the fact that he did.

( 11:57 ) I've always had a very good relationship, despite a fake Russia, Russia, Russia haunt that we had. But we've always had a great relationship, very good relationship, strong relationship with Russia. That's a good thing, not a bad thing, by the the way. That's a very good thing. It's good to get along with Kim Jong Un, and it's good to get along with everybody, including President Lee. It's good to get along. I get along with the foreign leaders. You see that with the biggest group of foreign leaders that we've ever had. Don't forget, the European Union was here also, representing a large group of countries just recently.

( 12:31 ) I believe that we're going to get that war straightened out, we're going to get it done. I don't know that they'll meet. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. They'd like me to be at the meeting. I say, "You guys ought to work it out. It's between you, it's not us." In the meantime, we're not spending any money, as you know, on Ukraine. We're selling military equipment to NATO. NATO now has taken in a large amount of money from

President Donald Trump ( 13:00 ):

… the countries, they're taking in 5% of GDP versus 2%. They're paying the 5%. They never paid the 2%, most of them or a lot of them. NATO has a lot of money. We are selling military equipment to NATO at full price and NATO is distributing that equipment to wherever they are. I mean perhaps to Ukraine. So NATO is working with Ukraine.

( 13:23 ) Biden was giving hundreds of billions of dollars, just willy-nilly just giving money. He had no idea where it was going. It was terrible what was happening. So we're not involved anymore in terms of the cost. We're in for $350 billion.

( 13:37 ) As you know, I also got the rare earth deal done with Ukraine, which was worth much more than the $350 billion. But I'm not interested in the money so much, even though we've done a great job in that regard. I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in stopping a war where last week, 7,109 soldiers died, both Russian and Ukraine. Such a waste of life and humanity. They're not from this country, they're not from any other country other than Ukraine for the most part, other than Ukraine and Russia. But it's a very important thing to me to stop it.

( 14:15 ) I stopped seven wars, wars that were raging, one for 31 years, the Congo, and as you know, Rwanda, one for 35 years. I don't have to go into them, you know the list better than I do, but we stopped a lot of wars, including you think about it, India and Pakistan, which was probably two weeks away from being a nuclear war. They were shooting down airplanes all over the place. So I'm very proud of that.

( 14:41 ) I thought this would be in many ways the easiest way. I have a very good relationship with Putin. I thought it would be the easiest one to stop. And it's really not. It's very complex. It's very personal from their standpoint is tremendous dislike personally between the two men, and we're going to have to straighten that out. But I would like to see them meet first. They'd like me to be there. I may be there. I may not. I'll see. But I wanted them to work out their differences first because it is ultimately between them. And when that happens, I think we'll get an end.

Speaker 4 ( 15:11 ):

Maybe they meet. Maybe they don't. How long are you willing to let this play out? And if they don't meet, will there be consequences, and how soon for Russia?

President Donald Trump ( 15:19 ):

Yeah, there could be very big consequences, but we'll see what happens. There might be very big consequences because this is something that has to end. This war would've never taken place and for four years it didn't take place. But if I were president, this war would've never taken place.

( 15:33 ) There has not been a war like this since the Second World war. This is the biggest thing that's happened in terms of warfare wars. It's a whole new form of fighting. It's a drone fighting. It's a drone war. Nope. A drone war never existed before. And we're actually studying it from the standpoint of Pete Hegseth and everybody we're studying it and studying it very carefully. This is a whole new form of war, but it's a violent war and there has been nothing like this since the Second World War.

( 16:02 ) So we'll see what happens over the next week or two. And at that point I'll step in very strongly, and if I have to be there, I'll be there and we'll either have a deal or we won't. But a lot of people are dying and I want to get this up.

Speaker 4 ( 16:17 ):

Mr. President, Kim Jong Un wants to meet. When do you want to meet with him?

President Donald Trump ( 16:23 ):

With who?

Speaker 4 ( 16:23 ):

The Korean leader wants to meet. How soon would you?

President Donald Trump ( 16:26 ):

Yeah, we want to have a meeting. I'd like to have a meeting. I get along great with him. You were there. We even had a press conference. He had his first press conference. Kim Jong Un had a press conference. This was a little different press conference. I said, "Have you done a press conference before?" "No." And you know what? He did great. It was a great press conference actually. It was historic. I doubt he's done one since. But I said, "Would you like to meet the fake news?" He goes, "Whatever you want to do." And they came in and they came in like you've never seen anything like it. And then he said, " Enough," and that was the end of the press conference. It was the end. It ended very rapidly, but I think he had a good time. I look forward to meeting with Kim Jong Un in the appropriate future.

Speaker 5 ( 17:14 ):

Mr. President, on South Korea. Would you reduce the number of forces in South Korea so that the United States could have more flexibility in the region?

President Donald Trump ( 17:27 ):

Say it.

Speaker 5 ( 17:27 ):

Would you consider reducing the number of US forces in South Korea so that the United States can have more flexibility?

President Donald Trump ( 17:28 ):

Well, I don't want to say that now because we've been friends and we're friends. And look, we have a lot of people. We have over 40,000 troops in South Korea. As you know, South Korea agreed to pay for that during my last term. And then when Biden came in, they complained to Biden that I wasn't a nice person and he agreed not to pay. He gave up billions of dollars. We were getting paid billions of dollars. But then Biden ended that for whatever reason. It's unbelievable that he did.

( 17:57 ) But we have a very good relationship militarily. They would say, "But we gave you land." I said, "No, you didn't. You leased us land. There's a big difference between giving and leasing." And maybe one of the things I'd like to do is ask them to give us ownership of the land while we have the big fort. We spent a lot of money building a fort and there was a contribution made by South Korea, but I would like to see if we could get rid of the lease and get ownership of the land where we have a massive military base.

Speaker 5 ( 18:30 ):

Would you go?

Speaker 6 ( 18:30 ):

Mr. President-

Speaker 7 ( 18:30 ):

Thank you, Mr. president. How are you planning to meet? I also want to ask this question to Mr. President Myung.

President Donald Trump ( 18:35 ):

Who are you with?

Speaker 7 ( 18:37 ):

I'm [inaudible 00:18:37] from South Korea's Arirang TV.

President Donald Trump ( 18:38 ):

Good.

Speaker 7 ( 18:39 ):

Thank you so much. So as mentioned earlier, United States is South Korea's most important and closest ally. So in this point of view, I would like to ask you and also President Lee, what do you think are the key ways to make the South Korea-US alliance greater?

President Donald Trump ( 18:54 ):

Well, I think it's great now, and I feel very warmly toward South Korea. I will tell you that I have a lot of people in business that I deal with that are from South Korea. They love Trump because they feel I've saved. I think you would've had a nuclear war by war. I think you would've had a nuclear war. North Korea and South Korea, I think it would've been a disaster. You're only 60 miles away from Seoul. They don't even need nuclear. They have their cannons, you know howitzers and they have them buried in the mountain. You know what I'm talking about.

( 19:25 ) And I think you would've had, if I didn't win that election, if Hillary Clinton, crooked Hillary won that election, I think you would've had a nuclear war. It would've taken place and it would've been horrendous for everybody, including them. It would've been very bad for them because we would've had to enter the picture. And we are the most powerful nuclear country in the world by far. Russia's second. China's third. China's going to catch eventually five or six years. They're working to catch.

( 19:53 ) One of the things we're trying to do with Russia and with China is denuclearization. And it's very important. One of the things I discussed with President Putin the other day, it wasn't just that. It was also other things. And I think the denuclearization is a very, it's a big aim, but Russia is willing to do it, and I think China's going to be willing to do it too.

( 20:19 ) We can't let nuclear weapons proliferate. We have to stop nuclear weapons. The power is too great. Okay. Thank you.

Speaker 8 ( 20:27 ):

Mr. President, I'd like to ask you further question about South Korea and US alliance. I'm Anna from the Korea Times, and I'd like to ask you about the trade deal that's on the table. You mentioned about the shipbuilding industry and President Lee mentioned about the manufacturing industry, and what other areas or sectors that you intend to focus on this trade deal because Korea is bringing in many investments and trade jobs as well. So I'd like to know the opinions of both, how to get a beneficial outcomes for both countries through this deal.

President Donald Trump ( 21:01 ):

We get along great 'cause we really sort of need each other. We love what they do. We love their product. We love their ships. We love a lot of the things that they make. And they love what we have. We're dealing with them on Alaska, having to do with the oil they need. You need oil, and we have it. So we have a big advantage in that way. We have a big … We have more oil and gas and coal and energy than any other country in the world by far.

( 21:28 ) For whatever reason, God was very good to us. He gave us the greatest. We didn't use it. We started to use wind. Wind doesn't work. They started to use solar panels that took over the land all over the Midwest where the farmers said, "What happened to my land?" They'd have a 10-mile-by-10-mile solar field that they couldn't farm. The most valuable land, farming land in the world, probably the most vibrant in the world. And they put solar plants all over the place. It's ridiculous. A big, massive black field of solar that all comes out of China. All plastic, all comes out of China.

( 22:02 ) But we have the greatest amount of energy in the world and we're dealing with South Korea. As you know, in Alaska, we're going to be making a deal, a joint venture with South Korea. Japan is involved, also very strongly involved. So we have Japan and South Korea and we're actually the closest. It seems like quite far away, Alaska and Korea, but actually it's right up the little ocean, right up the little Pacific Ocean. It's actually pretty close, relatively speaking. But we have more oil and gas and coal than any other nation in the world by far. And we're going to use it. And that's the thing that South Korea, I think most wants from us, I would think.

Speaker 9 ( 22:42 ):

Mr. President, would you go back to the DMZ to meet with the North Korean leader?

President Donald Trump ( 22:49 ):

Say it.

Speaker 9 ( 22:49 ):

Would you go back to the DMZ to meet with the North Korean leader?

President Donald Trump ( 22:52 ):

I loved it. Remember when I walked across the line and everyone went crazy, especially Secret Service. I would say they were [inaudible 00:23:00] And I looked into those windows, you know the windows, the glass that you could only see if you looked direct because there was all sorts of stuff. But I looked in and I saw more rifles pointing at me than you could … There were a lot of rifles in that building. The Secret Service was not happy. You know the buildings I'm talking about, the two blue buildings on each side? And I walked up the middle and I looked in the window and I saw more guns in that room than I've ever seen in my life. I looked at the other side and it was the same thing. And yet I felt safe.

( 23:33 ) I felt safe 'cause I have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un. I hope it stays that way. I think it will. I have a very good relationship. I understand him. I spend a lot of free time with him talking about things that we probably aren't supposed to talk about and I just, I get along with him really well. I think he has a country of great potential, tremendous potential.

Speaker 9 ( 23:56 ):

Is it possible you meet him this year or maybe next year?

President Donald Trump ( 23:59 ):

Well, I'm meeting a lot of people. I mean, it's hard to say that, but I'd like to meet him this year. President Xi would like me to come to China. It's a very important relationship. As you know, we're taking a lot of money in from China because of the tariffs and different things, and it's a very important relationship. We're going to get along good with China.

( 24:21 ) I hear so many stories about we're not going to allow their students. We're going to allow their students to come in. We're going to allow, it's very important, 600,000 students. It's very important. But we're going to get along with China.

( 24:32 ) But it's a different relationship that we have now with China. It's a much better relationship economically than it was before. With Biden, boy, what he allowed that. I mean, they just took him to the cleaners. You know the expression, they took him to the cleaners? I'm sure they have an equal expression in South Korea, but they took that guy out for a ride like nobody's ever been ridden before. Terrible.

( 24:55 ) But we have a very strong relationship, Howard, I would say economically with China now getting much better. They have to give us magnets. If they don't give us magnets, then we have to charge them 200% tariff or something, but we are not going to have a problem, I don't think, with that. I think that's perhaps behind us.

( 25:15 ) China intelligently went and they sort of took a monopoly of the world's magnets and nobody needed magnets until they convinced everybody 20 years ago, let's all do magnets. There were many other ways that the world could have gone. It'll take us probably a year to have them. We are heavy into the world of magnets now, only from a national security standpoint. But we have a powerful thing. It's airplane parts. They have many Boeing jets. They had 200 jets that didn't fly, and I've sent them all based on his word, I sent them all of the parts so their planes can fly. I could have held them back. I didn't do that because of the relationship I have and their planes are now flying. We had

President Donald Trump ( 26:01 ):

200 of their planes were unable to fly because we were not giving them Boeing parts purposely because they weren't giving us magnets, therefore we weren't giving them. But we have a much more powerful thing: that's tariffs. If we wanted to put a hundred percent, 200% tariffs on, we wouldn't do any business with China. And that would be okay too if we had to. But the magnet situation, we have tremendous power over them and they have some power over us with magnets. We're going to have a lot of magnets in a pretty short period of time. In fact, we'll have so many we won't know what to do with them. But you know the story, it's a very interesting history with magnets and it really is, because presidents not being business people, they allowed that to happen and they shouldn't have.

( 26:45 ) But we have much more, I mean, look, in terms of playing the cards, we have much bigger and better cards than they do. But with that being said, I think we have a great relationship. I spoke to President Xi fairly recently and at some point, probably during this year or shortly thereafter, we'll go to China and I think we're going to see a magnificent side. It's a great country.

Speaker 10 ( 27:06 ):

You and President Xi actually are planning to go to China, you mentioned either this year or next year. Could you please share more details about your plans going to China and also President Xi, I think …

President Donald Trump ( 27:18 ):

Maybe we'll go together. Do you want to go together? We can share a plane. We'll save energy. We'll save a little … You know the ozone? The ozone layer. Remember, President Obama used to talk about the ozone layer and then he'd fly to Hawaii to play around the golf in a 747.

Speaker 11 ( 27:35 ):

[foreign language 00:27:37].

Speaker 12 ( 27:35 ):

[foreign language 00:27:37].

President Donald Trump ( 27:36 ):

I sort of meant jokingly, but if you want, you can.

President Xi ( 27:50 ):

I would like to go with, [inaudible 00:27:53] I accept.

President Donald Trump ( 27:55 ):

Did he accept? If you want to go. I'm going to get special permission. I'm sure you can go, but we're going to have a great relationship with China. I mean, it is happening. You see it. It's happening. They have some cards, we have incredible cards, but I don't want to play those cards. If I played those cards, that would destroy China. I'm not going to play those cards.

Speaker 3 ( 28:15 ):

Mr. President on the National Guard, you've talked a lot about democratic-run cities and states. Would you also consider sending the National Guard into red states and red cities that are also seeing high crime?

President Donald Trump ( 28:25 ):

Sure. But there aren't that many of them. If you look at the top 25 cities for crime, just about every one of those cities is run by Democrats. And one of the bad things they did, cashless bail, if you look back on times, when they allowed a murderer out that afternoon, he'd killed somebody. And then a couple of hours later, he's walking the streets again, oftentimes killing again rapidly. Cashless bail is a disaster. You saw we had a news conference today on that, wiping it out in D.C., immediately wiping it out. It started in New York, I must tell you. And it is been a horrible thing for crime, especially violent crime. So we're going to end cashless bail. Yes, thank you.

Speaker 14 ( 29:08 ):

When will you deploy to Chicago and how long are you keeping troops here in Washington DC?

President Donald Trump ( 29:15 ):

We've just had a little discussion. I really want to be appreciated when we go into a city and wipe out the crime. So D.C., it sounds so horrible. I'm embarrassed to say it in front of you because they don't have anything like this. Washington D.C., sir, has not had a murder in 11 days.

( 29:33 ) Now he's saying that's a horrible thing to hear because they don't have murders forever. But Washington D.C., if you go back and check, it's been many years since we went a week without having a murder. Now we haven't had, and I would say that Washington D.C. right now is much safer than Seoul. You know why? Because we have a friendly neighbor. We have more friendly neighbors. You have a different kind of problem. We all have different problems. But Washington D.C. is a very safe city right now. People are going out to dinner, restaurants are opening. Restaurants that were going to close are now going to stay open. Friends of mine are going out to dinner all the time. They didn't go out to dinner for four years. It went rampant during the Biden years, Biden, just rampant.

( 30:22 ) That's why it … Susie is very close to the mayor and has a lot of respect for her but I view it maybe a little differently because the mayor would say that it's gotten better for 30 years. It's gotten better. No, it's gotten worse. And the worst day of all was when we just got to office for the second time, and it's in very bad shape. So the mayor shouldn't be saying that violent crime has been getting better. It's been getting much worse. And the day I took office, it was the worst. And we did some minor things, made it a little bit better. But then we said, look, we got to stop it because too many people getting killed and we have not had a murder in 11 days. It sounds crazy. I hate to say this in front of this gentleman who I respect, because they don't have murders for years, but we have not had a murder in 11 days. And that's going to go on for a long time.

( 31:13 ) And there will be, I guess it'll happen a little bit, but we have a very safe city. This is one of the safer cities right now in the country. And in a short period of time, it'll be like the border. Nobody came in through our border for the last 90 days, three months. We had zero illegal aliens from the Congo, from South America, from all over the world, from prisons, coming in, pouring into our country. Nobody, not one person. And this is done by a liberal group, a liberal think tank. They do the work. Not one person has come into our country. Think of that. It's been amazing. And I didn't have to go back to Congress and ask … Biden could have done this by himself. I did. I said, "Close the borders." We had the great Tom Homan. We had Kristi, as you know, know Kristi Noem, who did a fantastic job. She's doing a fantastic job.

( 32:02 ) Pete Hegseth has been incredible with the, as I call it, the Department of War. We call it the Department of Defense. But between us, I think we're going to change the name. You want to know the truth? I think we're going to have some information on that maybe soon. But I think because Department of Defense, we won the World War I, World War Two. It was called the Department of War. And to me, that's really what it is. Defense is a part of that. But I have a feeling we're going to be changing. I'm talking to the people. Everybody likes that. We had an unbelievable history of victory when it was Department of War. Then we changed it to Department of Defense. So that's a little thing has nothing to do with your country, but it's something that I think you're going to be hearing about or seeing about over the next couple of weeks. Probably that change is going to be made over the next week or so.

Speaker 13 ( 32:55 ):

Are there two Koreas, North and South, or is there one Korea waiting to be unified?

President Donald Trump ( 32:59 ):

Well, I know it as two Koreas mean. There was one Korea. It was a very large country and a very powerful country. And it was a country that went to war with China. President Xi explained it, went to war with China many times over the last 2000 years. You had many … I think he told me 51 times. So I remember I went to President Xi and said, "We're having a problem with North Korea. Straighten it out, would you please?" He said, "Well, we have been to war with them …" and I think he said 51 times. But at that time it was the whole of Korea. It wasn't north and south. And after he explained it, I said, "All right. Not going to be that easy. I guess you're right." But you had one Korea and it was a very big powerful nation. Now you have two big powerful nations, but you have essentially a wall in between.

Speaker 16 ( 33:53 ):

The comments, the posts and comments you made on South Korea early this morning, like raids on churches, going into U.S. military base, a purge, a revolution, how do you think about it?

Speaker 11 ( 34:07 ):

[foreign language 00:27:43].

President Donald Trump ( 34:16 ):

I heard from intel that there was a raid on churches. We are going to talk about that later. I haven't spoken about it yet, but will we meet. And that would be too bad if that's the case, but I did hear that from intel that there was a raid on churches, closing some churches. So we'll talk about that later. I could ask you now if you want?

Speaker 15 ( 34:38 ):

Mr. President, what conversation-

President Donald Trump ( 34:38 ):

Wait a minute. If you'd like, because it didn't sound to me like South Korea.

President Xi ( 35:31 ):

It hasn't been long since Korea has overcame the political turmoil following the self-coup by the former president. Currently, there is a fact-finding investigation by a special prosecutor that was appointed by the National Assembly, and this special prosecutor-

President Donald Trump ( 35:52 ):

Is his name, Deranged Jack Smith by any chance? They took him from our country, they questioned him. Deranged Jack is a deranged sick individual. But go ahead. Go ahead. I'm only kidding. Maybe I'm not.

President Xi ( 36:07 ):

That special prosecutor is not under my control. And so the special prosecutor is conducting a fact-finding investigation. And I would like to explain about what you said about U.S. bases. They did not conduct a search and seizure of American bases, but they looked into the control, the chain of command and the control system of the Korean military. And I would be happy to-

President Donald Trump ( 36:34 ):

That's okay.

President Xi ( 36:34 ):

Explain about this more in detail during our lunch meeting.

President Donald Trump ( 36:38 ):

I am sure it's a misunderstanding, but there is a rumor going around about churches, raiding churches. So we'll talk. I'm sure that's going to be worked out fine.

President Xi ( 36:45 ):

[inaudible 00:36:48].

President Donald Trump ( 36:47 ):

Yeah, please go ahead.

Speaker 15 ( 36:48 ):

Mr. President, what conversations have you had with Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about what is going on in Gaza? There was a UN-backed report that said there was a famine in Gaza. Based on what you know and what you've been briefed on, do you agree with that?

President Donald Trump ( 37:00 ):

So I mean, I deal with Bibi Netanyahu quite a bit and we had great success obviously in Iran. We knocked out their nuclear threat. That would've been a horror show, having them have a nuclear weapon, they would've used it too. We did very well there. Right now they're talking about Gaza City. There's always talking about something. At some point it's going to get settled. And I'm saying you better get it settled soon. You have to get it settled soon. And that means nobody can forget October 7th. People forget October 7th. That was one of the most brutal, I've seen some terrible things, some brutal things that was about as bad as it gets. And nobody can forget that. With that being said, it's got to get over with. It's got to get over with because between the hunger and all of the other, probably worse than hunger, death, pure death, people being killed.

( 37:48 ) And I am the one that brought back the hostages and I did it with that gentleman right there, Steve Witkoff and with Marco. All of us, the whole team, we worked together. Even the trade people worked on it with us. And we brought back a lot of the hostages. Now we're left with, would you say 20, Steve, or would you say it's less than 20?

Steve Witkoff ( 38:06 ):

I hope it's 20.

President Donald Trump ( 38:07 ):

He hopes it's 20 because some could be dead. That's what he means, I assume.

Steve Witkoff ( 38:12 ):

Yes.

President Donald Trump ( 38:12 ):

So we have 20, but there's rumors that some could be dead. It's a terrible situation over there. Terrible, terrible situation. But it's coming to a head, it's coming to an end. We are sending, we sent $60 million of food over there just recently. And I don't even know if people know it. We distributed it ourselves. We're giving a lot of food, spending a lot of money on food, getting it over there. We have a lot of food. We have a lot of oil, and we have the greatest farmers in the world, so we have a lot of food. So we're sending a lot of it over to Gaza and we're feeding a lot of people. But with all of that being said, it's a lot of people to feed. And I think that we will have, I think within the next two to three weeks, you're going to have pretty good

President Donald Trump ( 39:00 ):

… a conclusive ending. And it's a hard thing to say because they've been fighting for thousands of years, if you want to know, that's been a hotbed forever. But I think we're doing a very good job. But it does have to end. But people can't forget October 7th either.

Speaker 17 ( 39:22 ):

Do you plan to attend APEC Summit to be heard in Korea?

President Donald Trump ( 39:27 ):

The summit in South Korea?

Speaker 17 ( 39:28 ):

Yes, sir, in November.

President Donald Trump ( 39:29 ):

I'd love to, I'd love to. Last time I spoke in front of your parliament, and I loved doing that, beautiful respect they had for our country, and a beautiful room, I remember how beautiful it was, and I enjoyed doing it. No, I could see going, I think I'm going for a trade meeting to South Korea pretty soon, you're hosting a trade meeting, so I can sneak away from that trade meeting and we'll go and do something for the president if he'd like me to do that. Okay. So we'll be going there fairly soon.

Speaker 17 ( 39:55 ):

If you can, then it's good chance to meet up Kim Jong-un again or maybe Xi Jinping. How do you think of it?

President Donald Trump ( 40:06 ):

You mean set them up together?

Speaker 17 ( 40:07 ):

Yes.

President Donald Trump ( 40:08 ):

That'd be interesting. We'll arrange a meeting between you and Kim Jong-un. Would you like that? That's a very tough question right there. I don't know where that question is leading. Anyway, look, I get along great with Kim Jong-un. And whatever I can do, having to do with South Korea and getting people together, you should get together, right? Yes ma'am? What a beautiful smile. [inaudible 00:40:39] turn out to be the worst one in the room.

Speaker 18 ( 40:43 ):

I ask about MASGA project. MASGA project.

Speaker 21 ( 40:45 ):

Make America Ships Great Again.

President Donald Trump ( 40:49 ):

Yeah. Oh yeah, we're going to do that. I think we're going to do that very strongly. We're going to have a big, within a period of, it takes a while, that's a hard one to start, some companies you can start easily. Shipbuilding is a tough one to start but we'll be doing that. Now with that being said, we make the best submarines anywhere in the world. We make submarines. We're 25 years ahead of anybody else in submarines. So we do that. But we really gave up the shipbuilding industry foolishly many years ago. But we're going to start it up again. We're going to be making our own ships again soon. Okay. How about one or two more?

Speaker 19 ( 41:27 ):

Have you been briefed on the search of John Bolton's home and office from Friday, have you been briefed on that?

President Donald Trump ( 41:30 ):

I have not been briefed, no. I read it just like you did. I was never a fan of his, I thought he was stupid. I thought he was a guy that only wanted to go into war, he liked killing people. I thought he was essentially a bad guy. But I'm not involved in that no. You'd have to ask Pam Bondi about that.

President Xi ( 41:49 ):

Are more raids coming, sir? Are more raids like that coming, sir? Are more raids like the one on John Bolton's house coming?

President Donald Trump ( 41:57 ):

More raids? I don't know. You'd have to ask the Department of Justice. They raided my house, I can tell you that. They did a big raid on my house. They took away everything that wasn't pinned down. And they took away some of that too. No. They raided Mar-a-Lago. They started that. These were bad people that we had in our government before. They raided Mar-a-Lago. They went into my wife's area, they went into my son's area, my young son. And what they did was a disgrace. But how did it work out? I see, we're in the Oval Office. I guess it didn't work out too well for them, did it? They are bad people. They're sick, they're sick people. And they came in with their guns into Mar-a-Lago, 98 people. I wasn't there, fortunately I wasn't there. But they are very evil, very sick people, that group. And if they would've won the election, this country wouldn't exist as we know it. This country would've been a failed country. And now it's the hottest country anywhere in the world by far. We are the hottest country in the world by far. Okay. Another question. Yes sir, go ahead.

Speaker 20 ( 43:11 ):

President Lee met with the Japanese prime minister before this summit.

President Donald Trump ( 43:15 ):

That's good.

Speaker 20 ( 43:15 ):

So is there something to discuss regarding the cooperation among South Korea, US and Japan?

President Donald Trump ( 43:24 ):

I think so. Look, Japan is a great ally of us. And I had a little bit of a hard time getting you two together because you're still thinking about comfort women, right? Comfort women, that's all they wanted to talk about was comfort women. And I thought that was settled a few times over the decades. But there is an overlapping problem with that. Perhaps I'm wrong in saying it, perhaps this isn't the right … But the whole issue of the women, comfort women very specifically, we talked. And that was a very big problem for Korea, not for Japan, Japan wanted to go, they want to get on, but Korea was very stuck on that. You understand? So I don't know, perhaps you'd like to answer. It's a good question. It was hard getting Japan and Korea together because of what took place a long time ago. But Japan wants to do it I can say, Korea is a little bit more tenuous. Please.

President Xi ( 44:48 ):

Trilateral cooperation among Korea, the US and Japan is very important. And better Korea-Japan relations is also important for the Korea-US relationship as well. Because I know that President Trump, that you put emphasis on trilateral cooperation, I made a visit to Japan before coming to the US to settle all the difficult issues that we have.

President Donald Trump ( 45:28 ):

Good. Well, Japan wants to get along very well with you. And I find them to be great people, great country obviously. And they want very much to get along with South Korea. And you have something in common, you want to solve the North Korea problem. But Japan very much wants to get along with you, and I'm sure they will. I find the people that I deal with to be wonderful people actually. As I do with you.

President Xi ( 46:04 ):

So when I visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Ishiba, I realized that many of the obstacles that existed between our two countries have now been removed.

President Donald Trump ( 46:13 ):

True. During my term, we removed them during my term. There was an overlay a little bit, but we removed many of those obstacles during my term.

( 46:24 ) And if you look at Prime Minister Abe, who was a great man, he was a great friend of mine, and he was assassinated, but he felt very warmly toward your country I can tell you that. And the current prime minister, who I've gotten to know very well, feels the same way. So I think you're going to have a great relationship with Japan.

( 46:44 ) Steve, go ahead.

Steve ( 46:45 ):

Just to close the loop on Gaza. Is there a diplomatic push underway to try to get all this to end?

President Donald Trump ( 46:51 ):

Oh, there's a diplomatic push.

Steve ( 46:52 ):

No. Is there?

President Donald Trump ( 46:53 ):

There has been, yeah, sure. Right now, Steve, I would say a very serious diplomatic push. Marco or Steve? Marco, do you want to answer that first?

Marco ( 47:02 ):

Yeah, it's never stopped. We've always looked to find a solution there. Ultimately, as the president said, we want it to end. It has to end with no Hamas.

Steve ( 47:13 ):

Thank you, sir.

President Donald Trump ( 47:13 ):

Steve, where are we?

Steve ( 47:15 ):

I would say that we wouldn't be anywhere but for the President's truth last week, which was a statement to Hamas that they better get their act together and get to the peace table. But for that, it would've been all stalled. So as usual, he is the man who moves it.

Steve ( 47:33 ):

Thank you, sir.

President Donald Trump ( 47:33 ):

Thank you. Thank you very much everybody.

Speaker 22 ( 47:41 ):

Thank you guys. [inaudible 00:47:42] let's go, let's go. [inaudible 00:47:42] Thank you. Thank you guys. Let's go, let's go. Thank you. Straight out the door. Thanks guys. Let's go, let's go. Thanks guys. Let's go. Let's go. Come on, come on. Come on guys, let's go. [inaudible 00:47:51] Thanks guys. Thanks guys. This way. Thank you. Keep going, keep going. We're out, we're out. Thank you guys. Out the door. [inaudible 00:48:04] Thank you.
