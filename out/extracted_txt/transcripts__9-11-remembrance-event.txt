Music ( 15:19 ):

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved and set me free. I once was lost, but now am found, was blind but now I see. 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed. The Lord hath promised good to me, His word my hope secures. He will my shield and portion be as long as life endures. When we've been there 10,000 years, bright shining as the sun, we've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun.

Speaker 4 ( 19:08 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for the invocation provided by the Chief of Navy Chaplains, Rear Admiral Gregory Todd.

Gregory Todd ( 19:16 ):

Let us pray.

( 19:20 ) Eternal Father, always more ready to hear our prayers than we are to pray. Mercifully, grant us your presence with us today that we may be comforted as we reflect on the events of that fateful day and strengthen for the tasks ahead.

( 19:40 ) While our memory of the violence of September 11th is 24-years-old, for many of us the pain still lingers as we consider the heroic sacrifices made by many that day and by many more in the years of war that resulted. For those who grieve, we pray in the sentiment of Abraham Lincoln, that you, oh Lord, would assuage the anguish of their bereavement and leave only the cherished memory of the loved and lost and the solemn pride for those who have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.

( 20:18 ) For those of our day who have taken up the cause to secure our homeland, to wield the sword in righteousness, to protect our neighbors, grant prudence to execute justice with honor, always mindful we are under Your divine gaze. Grant the blessing of wisdom and insight for our leaders that they may be guided to do Your will. Grant humility throughout our land, acknowledging your goodness to us.

( 20:46 ) And finally, we offer supplications for those who currently are deployed, underway, or on duty for our nation. Surround them with the protection of the angels and a joyful reunion with faithful loved ones.

( 21:01 ) In Your most holy name, amen.

( 21:06 ) Please join me for a moment of silence for that minute of impact.

Speaker 4 ( 23:30 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated. Ladies and gentlemen, General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Dan Caine ( 23:35 ):

Good morning, Mr. President, Madam First Lady, Secretary Hegseth, members of the president's Cabinet and leaders from across government, the military, distinguished visitors, veterans, first responders, fellow Americans, and most importantly, the families of our fallen from that day. Thank you for being here to gather in remembrance, to grieve our nation's loss and draw strength from the heroism Americans demonstrated that day.

( 24:14 ) September 11th reminds us that even in the darkest of times, American strength endures. And if attacked, we will immediately fight back. 24 years ago, on a beautiful morning here in Washington, American Airlines flight 77 took off at 8:20 AM from Dulles International Airport with 59 passengers and crew bound from Los Angeles.

( 24:48 ) Here at the Pentagon, soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guard men and civilians began what they thought would be an ordinary day of service. They kissed their loved ones goodbye, dropped kids off at daycare, and commuted in here for another day of duty, having no idea what they were about to face.

( 25:14 ) 200 miles north of here, Al-Qaeda terrorists took control of two aircraft, American Airlines flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175. At 8:46 AM the first plane was flown deliberately into the North Tower, and minutes later, the second airplane was flown into the second tower.

( 25:40 ) We all knew at that very moment that our world had changed, that America was at war. And then at 9:37 AM, just moments ago, 24 years ago, American Airlines flight 77 ripped through the west wall here at the Pentagon, where our flag outside the building now hangs. And this ground that we stand upon became hollowed.

( 26:10 ) 2,977 were lost in the attacks that morning. The conventional wisdom is that our nation went to war weeks later in Afghanistan. The truth is we went to war immediately, and America started to fight back before the attack was even over.

( 26:35 ) In New York City firefighters, police officers, paramedics, first responders, and everyday citizens charged into towers, climbing hundreds and hundreds of flights of stairs to rescue their fellow Americans. And right here in this courtyard at the Pentagon, as flames filled the corridors and smoke followed, service members and civilians went into that flame to save their fellow teammates.

( 27:09 ) They covered their faces with t-shirts, rolled in water to shield their skin, and pushed through the fire and rubble. They carried the wounded out, and they went back in again and again and again and again until others had to stop them from going back. And even as this building burned, the Pentagon never shut down. Survivors organized, and thousands went to work to defend our nation.

( 27:44 ) Then there were 40 first responders on United Airlines flight 93. 40 heroes who unlike us, who wear the cloth of our nation, never took an oath to protect and defend our nation. They just got on an airplane, and knowing full well what was happening, they found the courage and commitment to run forward in that airplane, sacrificing themselves over the fields of Pennsylvania to save Americans that they would never meet and never know. And I, for one, think of them every day and the gift of the courage that they gave my squadron mates and I on that day.

( 28:33 ) So, as we come here together, let us reflect and let us never forget. Let us never forget the families who've shown us what true courage looks like as they continue to persevere through the years after. And let us all be inspired by the determination of those brave heroes who showed us that day what America is all about. And let anybody whoever considers attacking the United States remember those examples as well and the great American warrior spirit that was shown that day. Thank you very much.

( 29:20 ) And now it's my distinct honor to introduce our nation's Secretary of War. May we never forget our fallen. May we never forget our deployed. Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary of War, the Honorable Pete Hegseth.

Pete Hegseth ( 29:45 ):

24 years ago, Islamist terrorists massacred nearly 3,000 innocent American lives in New York City, Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and right here at the Pentagon. The building you see behind me, the

Speaker 5 ( 30:00 ):

The war department was targeted in an act of savage evil. And today, on these hollow grounds, we gather to honor those victims and heroes with the resolve to never forget. We gather to pay tribute to the first responders who charged into the flames and up the stairs, to those trapped on planes fighting their final fight, and to the families whose lives were forever altered by that fateful day. Like everyone in this audience, I remember exactly where I was when that first tower was struck. A college junior with a fresh set of Army fatigues in my dorm room closet, having just joined Army ROTC.

( 30:47 ) Like too many Americans, I was naive to the threats brewing abroad and infiltrating our doors. But from that day forward, I felt an unshakable call to action, a duty to defend our sacred homeland with everything I had. Like all of you, 9/11 was the ultimate validator to serve, but I was not alone. An entire generation of warriors stepped forward, willing to pay the ultimate price to exact retribution and secure our country. Forged in the crucibles of Afghanistan and Iraq, we stood watch in distant lands on dangerous missions, often in retrospect, nebulous missions, all to secure our people and so we could live in peace.

( 31:40 ) War is an enduring aspect of the human condition, a tool that when wielded wisely, ruthlessly punishes enemies intent on terrorizing or subjugating our nation. War must not become a mere tool for global social work, eager to risk American blood and treasure for utopian fever dreams. We should hit hard vengeance and returned home. For two decades, our warriors fought with valor every day far from home, even though sometimes their leaders gave them nation-building missions and half-baked exits. Thankfully today, we have an American military that President Trump has now rebuilt twice. Yet despite the weight of history, the Department of War will always honor the service of our warriors and all they left behind, never straying from the warrior ethos they and those on 9/11 embodied and deserve. We best honor their memory and the memory of 9/11 by learning the correct lessons of that day and the decades of courage that followed, full hearts, clear eyes. To every member of our war department, past and present, you are the best, the real elite, the real 1% of this nation.

( 33:13 ) Standing here today, we honor those 184 rings of the bells, souls lost at the Pentagon and in Flight 77. Even as first responders were grossly outnumbered by the wounded, many ran toward the chaos, cared for the injured, and comforted the dying. It was bedlam, but in that moment, American heroism was laid bare. That purpose, that spirit lives on in uniform today, despite such tragedies our Republic endured. It endured that day. It endured on Flight 93, charging that cockpit and at the Pentagon. It endured over those Islamists. It endured over two decades of war and it endured stronger, wiser, and tougher forced by the blood and courage of patriots.

( 34:12 ) Our job now is to ensure that future generations inherit a strong and vigilant America. 9/11 is vivid for me and all of you, but it will soon live only in the history books for our youngest. We must teach our children that the price of freedom we love is eternal vigilance. Instill in them the importance of upholding America's constitution, holding tight to our freedom and our faith, and relentlessly pursuing our enemies. Prepare them to defend this nation by the ballot, the wallet, and when necessary, the cloth of our country because the world remains a fighter's nest. It requires us. As I speak, hostile elements plot to curb our power and slaughter our people in our homeland, in our hemisphere, and halfway around the globe. Not everyone needs to wear a uniform, but some of us do. That is our profession, and our promise to this nation.

( 35:17 ) In closing a reading from scripture, Romans 5:3-4, "We rejoice in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, and character produces hope." On this day, 24 years ago, we suffer. In the years since, we have endured. Our service and sacrifice have forged our character. And today, we stand in hope for the future of our great nation. The young soldiers, who take the oath, give me hope. The young cops, who wear the badge, give me hope. The young firefighters, who answered the call, give me hope. The young agents, who patrol our border, give me hope.

( 36:13 ) The life, example, and even death of Christ's follower and American patriot, Charlie Kirk, give me hope. Sheer courage, no matter the arena. Charlie, we love you. We know that you have heard the Lord's words. Well done, good and faithful servant, full heart, clear eyes. Like those on 9/11, he'll never be forgotten. So I thank God for all of you and all of our fighters from that day to today and beyond. May God bless our warriors as they ruthlessly seek our enemies on behalf of the fellow citizens they love. We owe you and all of those who witnessed 9/11 nothing less. It is now my great honor to introduce to you our commander-in-chief, President Donald J. Trump.

Donald J. Trump ( 37:35 ):

Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. Before we begin, let me express the horror and grief, so many Americans at the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk. I felt Charlie was a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty, and an inspiration to millions and millions of people. Our prayers are with his wonderful wife, Erika, and his beautiful children. Fantastic people, they are. We miss him greatly, yet I have no doubt that Charlie's voice and the courage he put into the hearts of countless people, especially young people, will live on. I'm pleased to announce that I will soon be awarding Charlie Kirk posthumously the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The date of the ceremony will be announced that I can only guarantee you one thing that we will have a very big crowd, very, very big.

( 38:45 ) Thank you, my fellow Americans. 84 years ago this morning, the banks of the Potomac were filled with the clamor of construction workers who broke ground on the building, now known as the Pentagon, on September 11th, 1941. At the time, it was the biggest building ever built. From that moment forward, this structure stood as a monument to American strength, power, and cherished American freedom. Exactly six decades later on September 11th, 2001, those same walls built with the sweat and muscle, blood of our parents and grandparents were scarred by flame and shaken by terror as our country came face to face with pure evil.

( 39:41 ) On that fateful day, savage monsters attacked the very symbols of our civilization. Yet you're in Virginia and in New York and in the skies over Pennsylvania, Americans did not hesitate. They stood on their feet, and they showed the world that we will never yield. We will never bend, we will never give up, and our great American flag will never ever fail. That terrible morning 24 years ago, time itself stood still. The laughter of school children fell silent. The rush of hour traffic came to an absolute halt, and for 2,977 innocent souls and their families, the entire world came crashing down so suddenly.

( 40:38 ) In the quarter of a century since those acts of mass murder, 9/11 family members have felt the weight of missed birthdays and empty bedrooms, journals left unfinished and dreams left unfulfilled to every member that still feels the void every day of your lives. The First Lady and I unite with you in sorrow. And today as one nation, we renew our sacred vow that we will never forget September 11th, 2001. Amid the horror of that morning, some used cell phones and office lines, whispered their final words to those who mattered most. They whispered indeed.

( 41:27 ) At 8:59 a.m. aboard United Flight 175, Brian Sweeney called his wife Julie. He told her, "Do good, go have good times. I totally love you. I'll see you again. I'll meet you up there." Four minutes later, his plane hit the south tower of the World Trade Center. At 9:12 a.m. aboard American Airlines Flight 77, Renée May called her mom just the day before Renée had learned that she was seven weeks pregnant, but she never got the chance to share the news. She simply said, "I love you, mom." 25 minutes later, Renée's plane struck the Pentagon. So violent, a strike it was. At 9 53 a.m. aboard United Plane 93, Elizabeth Wainio called to stepmom, " They're getting ready to break into the cockpit. What do I do? I love you so much. They're going to break in." 10 minutes later, Flight 93 ended in the outer field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

( 42:47 ) At 10:25 a.m., Tom McGinnis was trapped on the 92nd floor of the North Tower when he told his wonderful wife Iliana, on the phone, " There are people jumping from the floors above us. We get out of here, there'll be a total miracle. I love you, darling. Take care of Caitlin," beautiful daughter. Three minutes later, the tower fell. Out of the ash, we witnessed the awesome power of that incredible love. We've seen it rise again. Out of the wreckage, we watched unbelievable courage suddenly take form. And out of the darkness, we saw the timeless truth of American character shine for the world to see. In America, we take blows, but we never buckle. We bleed, but we do not bow. And we defy the fear, endure the flames, and emerge from the crucible of every hardship, stronger, prouder, and greater than ever before.

( 43:59 ) Last year, we were a dead country. Now, we have the highest country anywhere in the world. In New York, there were heroes like Chuck Costello, a 46-year-old elevator mechanic and a member of the Knights of Columbus. He selflessly ran into the World Trade Center to free people trapped in the elevators. His body was not found until the following January, deep under the debris. While going through his belongings, Chuck's widow, Mary, a phenomenal woman, discovered a personal prayer written in his own words, "Help me to light the way for those in the dark. And when I enter the darkness, let me not panic, but patiently wait to remember the light." Beautiful words. When the time came, Chuck ran boldly into

Donald J. Trump ( 45:00 ):

Into the darkness of hell on Earth, and now he shines in the light of heaven above. We remember him this morning. That day, we learned that the American heroic spirit was all around us. We saw it in the police officers, the great firefighters, the service members here at the Pentagon, and then the hearts of every American who answered history's call. One such hero was Army Sergeant First class Steve Wartman, who was on the edge of the impact zone when this incredible Pentagon was hit. He was right there.

( 45:42 ) After leading hundreds of people through escape rats, Steve turned back and plunged into the inferno itself, pushing through the debris. He came upon us severely burned Navy lieutenant, the only survivor from the Navy Command Center. Only one. The wounded lieutenant looked into Steve's soul and said, "Don't let me die." Steve replied, "I won't. I've got you. Just hang on." He wheeled the lieutenant out of the wreckage of the back of a maintenance car before getting in the ambulance and taking him to Walter Reed Hospital. That man Steve saved, Lieutenant Kevin Schaffer, went on to join the elite team of CIA operatives who located Osama bin Laden. Steve, you're an American hero. We appreciate it. We appreciate what you've gone through. Please stand.

( 46:39 ) Good looking man. Very good looking guy. You remember that day? You remember that day? Thank you very much, sir. That was something. That was something. And the years that followed, America's warriors avenged our fallen and sent an unmistakable message to every enemy around the world. If you attack the United States of America, we will hunt you down and we will find you, go all over this sometimes magnificent earth. We will crush you without mercy and we will triumph without question. That's why we named the former Department of Defense, the Department of War. It will be different. We won the first World War. We won the second World War. We won everything before that and in between, and then we decided to change the name. Well, now we have it back to where we all want it. Everybody wanted it. Everybody is so happy to have it back. You will fail and America will win, win, win.

( 48:12 ) The enemy will always fail. 24 years have passed since that Tuesday morning in September, and an entire generation of Americans have come of age in a totally different world. While they cannot remember the agony of that day, they are carrying on the legacy of those who lost. Around 8:30 A.M. on the morning of the attacks, army Lieutenant Colonel Kip Taylor sent an email to his friends and family describing the joys of fatherhood and his excitement for the upcoming birth of his unborn son. He wrote, after you have kids, there are days that you just get going and you say, hi, honey, I'm home. What we do until that moment pales in comparison, but just that little statement, hi, honey. So American, so beautiful. But that's really the point of it all, isn't it? And hour after he sent that email, flight 77 flew into Colonel Taylor's Pentagon office and claimed the life of a very proud father and true patriot.

( 49:20 ) Six weeks later, on October 25th, 2001, Colonel Taylor's son, Luke was born. Luke then tragically lost his mom to cancer when he was just two years old, leaving him to be raised by his father's brother. As a young boy, Luke asked his uncle about the folded flag on the bookshelf. And when he learned about his dad's decades of devotion to the army and the horrors of September 11th, that's when he learned, Luke carried that memory with him and joined the ROTC as a college freshman. He graduated just last year, and I'm pleased to say he is with us today as a second lieutenant and doing very well, he's rising quickly in the infantry, preparing for Army Ranger School, the spitting image of his dad. They say, Luke says that every time he puts on a uniform, he feels connected to his father and to our country. But it was a father he never knew. Luke, your parents are together in heaven and they could not be prouder of the man that they have produced. They produced you. Those two great people produced you. Luke, please stand.

( 50:40 ) Thank you. You look good, Luke. You look good. They're looking down on you. They're very proud. This morning, we recall the light of America's best and bravest and the love that they showed in their final moments. In their memory, we make a solemn pledge and a noble promise we will honor always our great heroes. You are our heroes. There is a group of people that don't want to talk about our heroes, but we will always talk about our heroes. And that's the way our country is, and that's the way the people feel.

( 51:24 ) We will defend the nation they serve, the values they upheld and the freedom for which they died. We will support our troops. We will protect our families, that we will preserve the American way of life for every future generation. We will build taller, grow stronger, fight harder, and soar higher. And together, we will go forward as one people with one heart, one faith, one flag, and one glorious destiny under Almighty God. May God bless the memories of those who died and the heroes who fought and the soldiers who still stand watch. May God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 7 ( 52:26 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please remain standing for the singing of God Bless America and remain standing for the benediction.

Speaker 6 ( 52:27 ):

God Bless America, land that I love. Stand beside her, and guide her thru the night with a light from above. From the mountains, to the prairies, to the oceans, white with foam. God bless America, my home sweet home.

( 52:27 ) God Bless America, my home sweet home.

Speaker 8 ( 53:50 ):

Let us pray. All might and merciful God, gratefully, we acknowledge your presence with us this morning and implore your presence day by day. Grant peace for those who grieve, wisdom for those who lead, and courage for those standing to watch for our nation. We implore your blessing, not asking you to conform to our will, but that you would align us with yours. Now, may the Lord bless us and keep us, may the Lord make the space shine upon us and be gracious unto us. May the Lord lift up his countenance upon us and give us peace. Amen.

Speaker 7 ( 54:43 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's ceremony. Please remain seated until the departure of the official party. Thank you for joining us this morning. The Pentagon Memorial and the Pentagon Memorial Chapel are open until 12 P.M.

Speaker 6 ( 55:12 ):

Okay. We're just going to walk through it. [inaudible 00:58:12] This is if I'm… Lead back up. I'm sorry. Okay. I feel too close.

Speaker 7 ( 58:48 ):

I'll do it. Yeah. Hello. Mr. President, [inaudible 00:58:59]
