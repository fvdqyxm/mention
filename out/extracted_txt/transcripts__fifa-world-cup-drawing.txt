Gianni Infantino ( 00:16 ):

Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, this is your prize. This is your peace prize. There is also a beautiful medal for you that you can wear everywhere you want to go.

Donald Trump ( 00:32 ):

I'm going to wear it right now.

Gianni Infantino ( 00:33 ):

Okay. Let me hold. Fantastic. Excellent. And you will receive also, of course, a certificate which reads out, and I would read it out with your permission what are the reasons for you receiving this FIFA Peace Prize Football Unites the world. So the FIFA Peace Prize is presented annually on behalf of the billions of football loving people from around the world to a distinguished individual who exemplifies an unwavering commitment to advancing peace and unity throughout the world, through their notable leadership and action. And therefore, FIFA, the Federation Anti-National, the Football Association, awards the 2025 FIFA Peace Prize. Football unites the world to Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, in recognition of his exceptional and extraordinary actions to promote peace and unity around the world.

( 01:42 ) Friday, December 5th, 2025. This is the certificate. It's yours. Before giving you the floor, Mr. President, if I may say two words. Like everyone here in the room, we see images of war all over the world. And like everyone, we suffer for every child that dies. We cry with every mother that loses someone she loves. And we want to see hope. We want to see unity. We want to see a future. And I was lucky, Mr. President, to witness last, a few years ago, the Abraham Accord signatures a few months ago in Sharm el-Sheikh, the peace in the Middle East agreement regarding Gaza. I was in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur for the peace between Cambodia and Thailand yesterday here in Washington, the Washington Peace Agreement between Rwanda and the DRC.

( 03:06 ) Well, this is what we want from a leader, a leader that cares about the people. We want to live in a safe world, in a safe environment. We want to unite. That's what we do here today. That's what we'll do at the World Cup, Mr. President. And you definitely deserve the first FIFA Peace Prize for your action, for what you have obtained in your way, but you obtained it in an incredible way. And you can always count, Mr. President, my support, on the support of the entire football community or soccer community to help you make peace and make the world prosper all over the world. Thank you very much, Mr. President. The floor is all yours. Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 03:55 ):

Thank you. Well, thank you very much. This is truly one of the great honors of my life. And beyond awards, Gianni and I were discussing this, we saved millions and millions of lives. The Congo, as an example, over 10 million people killed and it was heading for another 10 million very quickly. And the fact that we could do that. India, Pakistan, so many different wars that were able to end. In some cases, a little bit before they started, just right before they started. It was going to be late, but we got them done. And it's such an honor to be with Gianni. I've known Gianni for so long. He's done such an incredible job.

( 04:36 ) And I have to tell you, you've set new records on ticket sales and not to bring that up because we don't want to bring a thing like that up right now, but it's an awfully nice tribute to you and to the game of football, or as we call it soccer, but football. And that is an amazing thing. The numbers are beyond any numbers that anybody, even beyond what Gianni thought was possible. I want to thank, by the way, my family, my great first lady, Melania, you're right here and thank you very much. And I think you're going to have an event, the likes of which maybe the world has never seen based on the enthusiasm that I've seen. I have never seen anything like it.

( 05:23 ) We've had a tremendous working relationship with Canada. We have our prime minister of Canada there and we have our president of Mexico and we've worked closely with those two countries. And the coordination and friendship and relationship has been outstanding. And I want to thank you both very much and your country very much. But most importantly, I just want to thank everybody. The world is a safer place now. The United States one year ago was not doing too well. And now I have to say we're the hottest country anywhere in the world and we're going to keep it that way. Thank you all. Thank you. Have a great time. And Gianni, a tremendous honor. Thank you.

Gianni Infantino ( 06:04 ):

Thank you. Thank you, pleasure. Thank you so much.

Mark Carney ( 06:04 ):

Thank you, my friend. I go behind, yeah?

Gianni Infantino ( 16:04 ):

Behind, yes. [foreign language 00:15:44] Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum. [foreign language 00:15:55]. And now the 45th and 47th President of the United States, Mr. Donald J. Trump. Mr. President, his way this way or his way, you can do what you want. This is your place. So this is the World Cup trophy. This is the official ball for the World Cup. And we are now going to do the draw, ladies and gentlemen. But before that, as is customary, there is always a question that the moderator asks the draw assistant. So I would like to start with Mr. Carney. How big a deal is it to co-host the World Cup for Canada? Difficult question, I know, but …

Mark Carney ( 16:55 ):

It is the biggest of deals, Gianni. It's the number one sport for Canadian boys and girls. Two thirds of the country watched the last World Cup. And we are partnered with the United States and Mexico welcoming the world. There's more than 200 nationalities in Canada, more than 200 nationalities in FIFA. The top 48 are coming to North America. It is going to be the biggest deal ever.

Gianni Infantino ( 17:24 ):

Fantastic. Thank you so much. [foreign language 00:17:34]

Claudia Sheinbaum ( 17:24 ):

[foreign language 00:17:56]

Gianni Infantino ( 18:29 ):

[foreign language 00:18:24]. Mr. President Trump, next summer is historic for the United States in more than one way. What does it mean to you that the FIFA World Cup is actually taking place in the United States 250th birthday? Special?

Donald Trump ( 18:44 ):

Well, for years, Gianni, they've thought soccer or football would be so big, so fast. And I remember, I shouldn't say this because it was a long time ago, but I remember watching Pelé, play on a team called the Cosmos. Pelé, who is fantastic, as you know, I assume one of the greats.

Gianni Infantino ( 19:03 ):

Oh, yes. Pelé. Let's applaud Pelé, please. One of the greatest.

Donald Trump ( 19:04 ):

And he scored three goals out there. I said, "That man can play." I was pretty young at that point. And who knew this was going to happen? But when you look at what has happened to football in the United States, again, soccer in the United States, we seem to never call it that because we have a little bit of a conflict with another thing that's called football. But when you think about it, shouldn't it really be called? I mean, this is football. There's no question about it. We have to come up with another name for the NFL stuff. It really doesn't make sense when you think about it. It's really football. But who would've thought it would've come to a level where you've set your all time season ticket ratings? Nobody's ever sold as many tickets and you're still a long way from that ball being kicked down the field. So I just want to congratulate you. What an incredible leap this has been, and congratulations to FIFA.

Gianni Infantino ( 20:05 ):

Thank you. Thank you, President. Big round of applause. And the best is still to come, of course. So let's start with the draw. I will just show you how it works. I've done a few of them. Don't be scared, right? So you have to basically mingle the balls a little bit. You can see, I show this for the public, you see? Mingle. And then one by one, we start with Mr. Carney. You pick one. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. You open it. You see there is a little paper inside. You take out the paper, these two things, you can throw them in here.

( 20:48 ) And then you can show to the public what you have drawn, which for me is FIFA, of course. I'm just the moderator. Mr. Carney, do you want to start? I'm ready. Don't forget and pick the right ball, please. Aha, already chosen. Okay. Let's see which team will be drawn by Mr. Mark Carney. Oh. Oh, Canada. Oh, congratulations. Canada, ladies and gentlemen, the first team drawn in this World Cup group. B1 for Canada, by the way. We can continue. [foreign language 00:21:36].

Claudia Sheinbaum ( 21:44 ):

Viva Mexico.

Gianni Infantino ( 22:01 ):

[foreign language 00:22:00]. President Trump, up to you. Don't forget to mingle. To mix.

Donald Trump ( 22:05 ):

I think I know what this is going to be now.

Gianni Infantino ( 22:07 ):

Everything.

Donald Trump ( 22:09 ):

But let's see.

Gianni Infantino ( 22:10 ):

Are you sure? Are you sure this is the ball? You can still change it if you want.

Donald Trump ( 22:15 ):

Does he know something that I don't know? Let's give it a shot.

Gianni Infantino ( 22:19 ):

Let's give it a shot. Let's give it a shot. I agree. Okay.

Donald Trump ( 22:27 ):

This is shocking.

Gianni Infantino ( 22:29 ):

United States of America. Excellent. Group D1. Can I ask all the three of you to lift like this on your chest, in front of your chest like this? Yeah. The name of the country, we will give a nice photo. Excellent. And if I can ask you to come in front here for another photo with the paper [foreign language 00:22:54]. There here where you can see the … here for another photo so that everyone can see what you have drawn. Here we are. Thank you very much. Well done. Congratulations. Great assistance. If I may take a selfie with the three of you.

Donald Trump ( 23:19 ):

Come. Come.

Gianni Infantino ( 23:23 ):

Come, come. Thank you very much.

Claudia Sheinbaum ( 23:28 ):

Thank you. Thank you.

Gianni Infantino ( 23:29 ):

Let's go.

Donald Trump ( 23:32 ):

Thank you everybody.
