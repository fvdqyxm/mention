Journalists ( 00:10 ):

Mr. President.

( 00:10 ) [inaudible 00:00:06].

( 00:10 ) Mr. President.

( 00:10 ) Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 00:11 ):

I had a great conversation with the highly respected president of Syria, and all of the things having to do with Syria and that area, working out very, very well. So we're very happy about it. Tom Homan, as you know, is in Minnesota now, he's meeting with the governor. And he's meeting with the mayor, I think later. And I hear that's all going very well also. I'm going to Iowa, some of you are coming with me, but I'm going to Iowa. And what can I say? The economy is good. It's all good. Prices are coming way down. And we have a lot of very positive news.

Journalists ( 00:46 ):

[inaudible 00:00:50]

( 00:46 ) Mr. President, do you believe that Alex Pretti's death was justified?

Donald Trump ( 00:54 ):

Well, you know, we're doing a big investigation. I want to see the investigation. I'm going to be watching over it. I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself.

Journalists ( 01:06 ):

[inaudible 00:01:05]

( 01:06 ) Mr. President, have you watched the video?

Donald Trump ( 01:13 ):

Yes.

Journalists ( 01:13 ):

Mr. President, is Kristi Noem going to step down?

Donald Trump ( 01:13 ):

No.

Journalists ( 01:13 ):

[inaudible 00:01:14]

( 01:13 ) The president of Venezuela said that she is not taking orders from you. What do you want to say about that?

Donald Trump ( 01:18 ):

Well, I don't know exactly what's going on there, but I haven't heard that at all. No, we have a very good relationship.

Journalists ( 01:24 ):

[inaudible 00:01:24]

( 01:24 ) What do you say to Alex Pretti's family?

( 01:24 ) [inaudible 00:01:34]

Donald Trump ( 01:33 ):

I'd like to see interest rates go down. Everything else is going down. We have the energy and fuel going down. We have gasoline in many states now at $1.99. Groceries are going down. We inherited a mess with very, very high prices, very, very high prices. And I will tell you, we've made a lot of progress. So we have the groceries going down, we have the energy going down, we have gasoline going down in a record clip. And that's what I want to do. We're doing well.

Journalists ( 02:05 ):

[inaudible 00:02:10].

Donald Trump ( 02:10 ):

Well, I'm looking at that whole situation. I love everybody, I love all of our people, I love his family. And it's a very sad situation.

Journalists ( 02:18 ):

[inaudible 00:02:21].

Donald Trump ( 02:20 ):

Yeah, please.

Journalists ( 02:20 ):

[inaudible 00:02:24].

Donald Trump ( 02:24 ):

I have, yeah. I think she's doing a very good job. I think she's doing a very good job. The border is totally secure. You forget, we had a border that I inherited where millions of people were coming through. Now we have a border where no one is coming through. They come into our country only legally. So you have to remember those things. People forget. As soon as you accomplish something, it goes into history and nobody ever wants to talk about it. We had a border that caused all of this problem. Biden caused ... and the Democrats caused this problem. They allowed tens of millions of people to come in. Many of them were murderers, many were drug dealers, drug addicts, people from mental institutions. They allowed these people to violate our country, to come into our country. And that's what we're talking about.

( 03:14 ) So if you remember, we had a horrible border, the worst border we've ever had ever in history. People were flowing through by, we think, 25 million people, not to mention drugs and everything else. And that border is absolutely closed.

Journalists ( 03:30 ):

[inaudible 00:03:36]

Donald Trump ( 03:43 ):

Our country is doing so well, prices are coming down. The border is really strong. If you remember, I probably got elected more than anything else on the border. We had a border that was open with 25 million people coming through with an open border policy, which was insane. And that's the policy that caused the problems that we have.

( 04:03 ) With all of that being said, with the ... Other than, I would say, just to put it accurately, Minnesota and in particular Minneapolis because it's not all of Minnesota, every city that we've gone to has been like literally crime has gone down 50, 60, 70, 80. In Washington, it's gone down, there's practically no crime. Washington is a great example. But you take a look at other cities, Memphis, Tennessee, the crime is down 78%. And you know where else it's down? It's down in Minnesota, it's down in Minneapolis and it's down very much because of the fact that we're there.

Journalists ( 04:44 ):

[inaudible 00:04:46]

Donald Trump ( 04:45 ):

We can't lose sight of the fact that we have to take murderers and drug lords and people from mental institutions that were dumped into our country through open borders of the Democrats, of Biden. And we're doing a great job.

Journalists ( 05:01 ):

[inaudible 00:05:02].

Donald Trump ( 05:02 ):

The other thing is, Tom Homan, he's there right now, he's with the governor and [inaudible 00:05:31] there. And I hear things are going very nicely.

Journalists ( 05:33 ):

[inaudible 00:05:33].

Donald Trump ( 05:33 ):

We're looking at some very good things happening on Ukraine and Russia. Very good things. Very good things are happening on Ukraine and Russia.

Journalists ( 05:36 ):

[inaudible 00:05:36].

( 05:36 ) On Gaza, Mr. President, where do we stand on Gaza, Mr. President?

Donald Trump ( 05:41 ):

I think Gaza is going very well. As you know, we got the last hostage back, the body of the hostage, and a lot of people thought that was impossible. So we got all of the hostages back, both living and dead. And I can tell you, you have parents that really appreciate it.

Journalists ( 05:58 ):

[inaudible 00:05:58]

Donald Trump ( 05:58 ):

Who was that?

Journalists ( 05:58 ):

Mr. President, your deputy chief of staff-

Donald Trump ( 05:58 ):

No, not [inaudible 00:06:09], no.

Journalists ( 05:58 ):

[inaudible 00:06:15]

Donald Trump ( 06:15 ):

With that being said, you know, you can't have guns, you can't walk in with guns, you just can't. And you can't, listen, you can't walk in with guns, you can't do that. But it's just a very unfortunate incident.

Journalists ( 06:25 ):

[inaudible 00:06:32].

Donald Trump ( 06:32 ):

We'll work something out, we'll work something out [inaudible 00:06:35].

Journalists ( 06:34 ):

[inaudible 00:06:39]
