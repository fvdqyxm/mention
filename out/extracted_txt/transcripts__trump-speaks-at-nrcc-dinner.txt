Tom Emmer ( 00:00 ):

Ready for that? But first we got a little treat for you, it's a little treat for me. I get to introduce a couple of guys who are going to come up here and I get to interview them. These are two people who are going to give us a lay of the political environment out there. They're going to talk about why Republicans and Donald Trump will defy history in 2026. First, Richard Hudson, the chair of the NRCC. Join us, Richard. With him, his trusted sidekick, these guys know more about our districts than anybody, Brian Jack, our new member from Georgia. I tell you, Brian, you are so professional, everywhere you go it's like you've been here for 20 years and yet you look so good.

Speaker 1 ( 00:59 ):

Well, thank you for that-

Tom Emmer ( 01:00 ):

It's not fair

Speaker 1 ( 01:01 ):

Mr. Whip, I appreciate that.

Tom Emmer ( 01:03 ):

All right, let's get started. Richard, this is your second cycle as chair of the NRCC, how did our efforts in the house and President Trump's vision for this country help to expand our house majority in the 2024 election?

Speaker 2 ( 01:19 ):

Well, great question, Tom. First, I just want to say thank you to all of you for being here. You are an important part of our team. We could not be successful, we could not grow this majority without your help. In fact, we wouldn't be in the majority without most of you here tonight, so thank you for being here. I hope you have a great time tonight. Tom Emmer, thank you for your incredible leadership. This man's the whip. Sometimes we think he actually needs a whip to get all the votes, but Tom Emmer has led us on tough vote after tough vote week after week. His leadership has just been incredible. So Tom, thank you for your strong leadership. I think one person stood up there for a minute, standing ovation. Listen, I love the way you phrase that question because the reason we're in the majority is because of President Donald J. Trump. The only way we're going to not only keep this majority but pick up some seats is if we deliver President Donald Trump's agenda because 77 million Americans said they want Trump to be their president again and they like his policies that he campaigned on. So it's up to us as the Congress to deliver those programs. If we do that, if we prove that we can govern, then they're going to give us an opportunity to make our case to them.

( 02:45 ) I'll tell you, 2026, we have a great opportunity. I've never seen a battleground that is more favorable to Republicans. We have 13 Democrats sitting in seats that Donald Trump carried, half of those seats are majority Hispanic that have been trending Republican for decades. We've got another 21 Democrats in seats that Donald Trump only lost by less than 5%. That is a whole lot of opportunity for us if we go find the right candidates, build strong campaigns around them and turn out our vote. That's where you come in. Thank you for giving us the resources to do that.

Tom Emmer ( 03:22 ):

All right, thanks Richard. Brian Jack, passing good policy is one thing, but how do we ensure that the American people feel those wins in their daily lives and understand that President Trump and House Republicans are the ones delivering them?

Speaker 1 ( 03:37 ):

Well, first and foremost, I'm incredibly grateful to be alongside both of you. I had a chance to work with Whip Emmer when he was actually chairman of the NRCC from 2019 to '23. Just to put into context, when you were chair, when you inherited the chairmanship our seat majority, or rather our seat minority, was 195 seats. Today we're at 220 in large part because of the work that both of you did and everybody in the room invested in. A 25 seat gain over the last six years, which is something we can continue to build upon.

( 04:09 ) But if I can just establish a little context as it relates to my background, I was the White House political director for President Trump. One thing that he's incredibly talented at, as we'll see tonight and we'll continue to see going forward, is championing what Congress has done to achieve his agenda. One of the things he's going to talk about writ large, I promise you, are the teller rallies that we instituted during the pandemic in 2020. He relentlessly made phone calls on behalf of our Republican colleagues and single-handedly delivered a lot of wins in these districts. He'll talk about it tonight, but using his megaphone, using his voice, leveraging his podium when he travels across the country will be imperative for us to share our story.

Tom Emmer ( 04:51 ):

Awesome, Richard, a contrast we've seen so far this year is that the Democrats have no vision, no message, and absolutely no leadership. How will Republicans capitalize on their dysfunction to show just how out of touch the Democrats are with the voters?

Speaker 2 ( 05:07 ):

Well, you're right, Tom. I mean the Democrats are completely lost. They are still focused on woke policies, open borders, and what pronoun you ought to be using. They have no agenda. All they can do is to try to attack us and try to poke holes. But as long as we stick together as a team, that's not going to work. I can tell you the NRCC, we know we're in a knife fight in a dark alley. We're not giving an inch. So like our first bill we passed, the Laken Riley Act, first bill Donald Trump was able to sign as president, it says, "If a criminal alien commits a crime, a violent crime in this country, we're going to lock them up and we're going to deport them." It's a great bill, but a whole lot of Democrats voted against it. Can you believe that?

( 05:55 ) Well, the day of that vote, we started a digital ad campaign attacking the vulnerable Democrats, the ones I mentioned, the 13 plus 21, in their districts educating their voters about that ridiculous vote they just took. Then we had our press team calling reporters at all the TV stations and newspapers in their districts to generate news stories, educating their voters about their ridiculous vote. We have been doing that on vote after vote, letting the world know how out of touch and radical these liberal Democrats are. We're going to continue to do that. So when we stick together as a team and we take a vote, like when we passed our budget resolution the first time we did the exact same thing to go into every one of those districts and let them know their member of Congress just voted for the largest tax increase in American history, just voted to cut the child tax credit in half. We're on offense. So as we stick together as a team, we're going to continue to weaponize these issues and educate their voters.

Tom Emmer ( 06:54 ):

Brian, you touched on this a little bit with your first answer, but I want to emphasize for everybody here that you worked for President Trump during his first term as both Deputy Political Director and Political Director Brian Jack, while Richard and I are working on the house side, Brian Jack is sitting at the desk with President Trump going over every single race. From those perspectives that you have, that experience you have Brian, how important is it for us to hold the house in 2026?

Speaker 1 ( 07:27 ):

Well, I mean, I think we all saw what happened when Democrats had the house from 2019 to 2020 and the threats that they imposed upon the agenda President Trump was elected to pass in 2016. So I think you're going to hear from him tonight over and over just how committed he is to engaging and leveraging that power that he has the podium when it goes into a district, when it goes into a state, it's an incredibly, incredibly powerful tool to educate voters about what we've done and what we're trying to do here this Congress. But if I could speak to, as well, just that personal side of him, and you're going to see this, and I think often it's not really touched on by the media, but he is so interested in the political nature and contours of every race around. He memorizes these races, he knows the candidates, he knows the issues, he understands sometimes a district has a different personality, if you will, than another district. His level of aptitude I think will be critical in one of our secret weapons this election cycle.

Tom Emmer ( 08:24 ):

All right, my final question is for both of you so I'm going to start with you Brian, as our leaders at the NRCC, it will be critical to turn policy wins into election night wins. How will delivering on the America first agenda impact the elections in November of 2026, Brian?

Speaker 1 ( 08:42 ):

Well, I'll start by just noting I'm one of 35 freshmen. We have two new freshmen with Randy Fine and Jimmy Patronus, who may be here. Great guys who people in the room helped elect. But of those 35 freshmen, we have five that are heavily endangered. Of those five, four flipped a Democrat seat, they beat a Democrat incumbent thanks to people in the room. That is, if I'm going to go in rank order, you've got Pennsylvania, Ryan McKenzie, Rob Bresnahan, you've got Tom Barrett in Michigan, Gabe Evans in Colorado, and Nick Begich in Alaska. We all talk all the time about what are we going to do? How are we going to ensure that we're going to have the success that we all need to have this election cycle? I'll tell you what I see over and over again are creative ways to go into their districts to sell the agenda, to sell what they're doing.

( 09:29 ) You've seen a lot of cabinet secretaries go into some of their districts to talk about some of the policy wins. You're seeing them introduce legislation on the floor and passing it. Two of the folks I just mentioned, Tom Barrett and Ryan McKenzie, they have subcommittee chairmanship. So we got to be out on television, we've got to be out selling the American agenda, the agenda that we were all elected to pass. If we do that and we're able to stick together on these tough votes and continue to deliver wins, it's just a constant rolling thunder approach for marketing. You're going to see us defy expectations, defy history, and yet again expand our majority in 2026.

Tom Emmer ( 10:04 ):

Richard?

Speaker 2 ( 10:05 ):

Well, I think Brian's exactly right and I'm so glad to have Brian as my partner at the NRCC. You're doing a fantastic job and really appreciate your leadership. Look, I started with this, we are in the majority because of Donald J. Trump. The American people, 77 million Americans said, "We want Donald Trump and we want his agenda." So if we want to get reelected in the house and we want to grow our majority, number one is we've got to show we can govern and we've got to deliver that agenda. When we do that, what is that agenda about? It's about securing the border. It's about unleashing American energy so that we can reduce prices. It's about resetting our trade imbalance with the world. It's common sense. His entire agenda is common sense, the American people want it.

( 10:52 ) So when we deliver it, then we can go talk about what we've done, what we've achieved, and we can go to the American people and ask them to rehire us. That will be the key to growing this majority is to be able to talk about the wins. Look, I know a lot of people are nervous right now about these tariffs. I've heard a little bit about this. Folks, it's been six days. It's been six days! Don't look at your stocks for a couple days. Donald Trump, when he was president, created the greatest economy in my lifetime and he's going to do it again and we have to trust him and we have to give him a little bit of time here. So we're going to stick with Trump, we're going to stick together, and then we're going to go back to the American people and say, "You hired us to do a job, we did a job, elect us again." That's how we're going to be successful.

Tom Emmer ( 11:43 ):

Great words, and I'm just going to add, everybody who's worried about what's happening right now needs to go back to 2016. The first three months of Donald Trump's first administration the market was down 30%, a year later it was up 60%. Nobody wants to talk about the history and people got to understand we are going to perform on reconciliation. We are going to deliver on President Trump's agenda. Reconciliation is a powerful tool. It's going to help us continue the Trump tax cuts, grow our economy, unleash American energy and cut the red tape. The 2017 Trump tax cuts created the greatest economic boom in modern history. But unless we act, those cuts are set to expire at the end of the year. Going to lock these tax cuts in place and give Americans the certainty they deserve is what this Republican majority is going to do. We're going to further secure our southern border and bolster our national security. Get ready because once Donald J. Trump signs our big beautiful bill, we got a whole lot of more work to do. Thanks everybody. Let's win in 2026.

Speaker 2 ( 12:55 ):

Thank you.

Speaker 4 ( 23:29 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for our invocation offered by Congressman August Flueger.

Speaker 5 ( 23:48 ):

What are good friends for, right? I don't know what they do in the Democrat side of the house, but we go to God before we have an event. Would y'all please bow your heads? Heavenly Father, we ask you for your blessing on our gathering, that your nourishment sustains our minds and bodies to do your will every day in service to the country that we love. We ask for your wisdom and guidance as we steer her spacious skies. We pray for our President, Donald J. Trump. We stand eternally grateful for your intervention and ask you to continue to protect him and the first family. We pray for our leaders who must remain good stewards of this great nation conceived in liberty. We pray for success in our shared and sacred mission that our country may always be that shining city upon the hill. We pray for those defending us at home and abroad and trust that they carry with them the famous cry from our battle hymn, "As he died to make men holy. Let us die to make men free." In your holy name we pray. Amen.

Speaker 4 ( 25:06 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance, please welcome Congressman Mike Carey.

Speaker 6 ( 25:26 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, if you please join me in saying the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America to the Republic which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Thank you all.

MUSIC ( 26:59 ):

Control of both the House and the Senate are on the line.

Speaker 3 ( 29:22 ):

Democrats need to net just four seats.

Speaker 9 ( 29:24 ):

The Republicans are in deep trouble when it comes to controlling the House.

Speaker 10 ( 29:28 ):

The deck is really stacked against them.

MUSIC ( 29:29 ):

We're going to win in places that you don't think about.

Speaker 11 ( 29:32 ):

January of 2025, Hakeem Jeffries will be speaker of the House.

Speaker 7 ( 29:37 ):

Nope, they doubted us, counted us out, but we won.

Speaker 8 ( 29:42 ):

The US House of Representatives is going to go to the Republicans.

Speaker 9 ( 29:47 ):

We'll be keeping control of the House of Representatives.

Speaker 10 ( 29:51 ):

This is close and it's going to be close.

Speaker 12 ( 29:53 ):

It wasn't close.

Speaker 13 ( 29:54 ):

It sounds like you're still processing.

Speaker 14 ( 29:55 ):

Richard Hudson has been re-elected as the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Speaker 15 ( 30:01 ):

Speaker Johnson put us on his back and carried us to the promise land. We're going to hold the house.

Speaker 16 ( 30:05 ):

They said we couldn't get anything done.

Speaker 9 ( 30:07 ):

Could their small House majority hamper that legislative agenda?

Speaker 17 ( 30:11 ):

House Republicans can't get out of their own way.

Speaker 18 ( 30:13 ):

They couldn't do anything significant without Democratic votes.

Speaker 19 ( 30:16 ):

Governing is actually for grownups, Republicans are children.

Speaker 16 ( 30:20 ):

But house Republicans got to work.

Speaker 20 ( 30:23 ):

Congress vowed to move real quickly on President-elect Donald Trump's promises.

Speaker 21 ( 30:27 ):

Congress wasting no time enacting President Trump's hardline vision.

Speaker 22 ( 30:30 ):

House has passed a bill to bar transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.

Speaker 23 ( 30:34 ):

The new House has just passed the Laken Riley Act.

Speaker 24 ( 30:38 ):

A big victory for House Republican leaders as their massive budget resolution advancing the Trump agenda.

Speaker 25 ( 30:44 ):

Well, something has changed in Washington, a strong America against-

Speaker 26 ( 30:47 ):

Severely underestimated House Republicans

Speaker 27 ( 30:49 ):

We're in sync, we're moving together.

Speaker 28 ( 30:51 ):

Republicans, we're moving as a well-oiled machine.

Speaker 29 ( 30:54 ):

So Trump and the GOP promises made, promises kept.

Speaker 30 ( 30:58 ):

Fulfilling a key promise to President Trump.

Speaker 31 ( 31:00 ):

We promise to deliver President Trump's full agenda.

Speaker 32 ( 31:04 ):

We're going to get the job done. Failure is not an option.

Speaker 33 ( 31:08 ):

Together with President Trump, we're going to grow this House majority because the American people are desperate for change. They're desperate for us to save this country, and together we're going to do that.

Speaker 9 ( 31:16 ):

And to my fellow citizens, America is back, and we are just getting started.

Speaker 6 ( 31:46 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage our host for the evening and the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Richard Hudson.

Speaker 2 ( 32:14 ):

All right, good evening. Welcome to the 2025 President's Dinner with President Donald J. Trump. To my colleagues, our friends in the Trump administration, our generous donors and the staff, families and friends who make it all happen, you are the reason we're winning and it is an honor to stand with you tonight. You're not just at another dinner, you're here because you believe in something bigger. We're on a mission to defend freedom, unleash opportunity, and show the world that America's best days are ahead thanks to President Donald J. Trump.

Speaker 2 ( 33:05 ):

All of you represent the engine of the America First movement. You refuse to sit on the sidelines while our country hangs in the balance. You're here because you know what's at stake, and you are ready to fight. Now, let me take a moment to recognize some of our special guests who are with us here tonight. We have several American heroes. Thanks to our foreign affairs chairman, the great Brian Mast of Florida. He's arranged for several veterans of our nation's military to be here in attendance. Gentlemen, thank you for your service and your sacrifice for this country. In fact, if you're a veteran or an active duty, please stand so we can recognize you, and thank you for your service. Next, I want to thank our leaders who are helping drive this mission forward, our conference chair, Lisa McClain, our whip, Tom Emmer, leader Steve Scalise, and our speaker Mike Johnson. You've unified this conference, and you've reminded the country what conservative leadership looks like. Thank you for your great leadership. Thank you for keeping us laser focused on delivering Donald Trump's agenda. Of course, later this evening, we're all going to hear from the 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Mr. President, welcome back. Thank you for your fearless leadership, your love for this country, and your unshakable commitment to putting the American people first.

( 35:06 ) You've changed. You've challenged the status quo. You've started rebuilding our economy. You've stood strong on the world stage, and now you're back to finish the job. House Republicans, we're proud to be on your team. We are ready to work with Donald J. Trump to make America great again. In 2024, folks, we beat the narrative back. We brought back President Trump. We flipped the Senate, and we held our house majority, and now we're going on offense. We're building a movement, folks, one rooted in common sense, rooted in hard work, in faith, in freedom, and everywhere we go, we're seeing something the Democrats have long since lost, and that's hope. Hope that the American dream is not fading. It's just getting started. Hope that our kids will inherit a country that's safer, that's stronger, that's freer than the one we grew up in.

( 36:10 ) Hope this nation founded on liberty, built by Patriots will once again lead the world by example. That's the spirit we're carrying into 2026. The Democrats have no message, no vision and no leadership. While we're fighting to lower cost, to secure the border, to back law enforcement, and to give parents a say in their kids' education, Democrats, they're obsessing over pronouns, plastic straws, and progressive talking points. While we're fighting for Main Street, they're still bowing to the far-left fringe, and while President Trump is restoring America's strength at home and abroad, Democrats are clinging to their broken playbook of weakness and wokeness, from small-town diners to union halls to border communities.

( 37:03 ) We are expanding this movement with candidates who look like America, and who will fight for America. That's veterans. It's first responders. It's entrepreneurs. It's moms and dads, fighters who know what it means to serve, what it means to sacrifice and what it means to lead. That's what you are fueling. That's why tonight matters. You're investing in the fight for this country, and I can't thank you enough. So, please keep showing up. Keep believing. Keep donating. They say don't give till it hurts. If you keep giving, keep giving till it feels good. What we do today and in the 2026 election will decide what kind of country we leave for our children and our grandchildren.

( 37:57 ) We're not just defending a house majority. We are defending the American dream, but the left isn't going to go away quietly. They've got millions of dollars in dark money, and they have the media on their side. We need backup, and our backup comes from all of you. Thank you to everyone in this room. I'm proud to announce that because of your hard work, because of your treasure that you've put into this fight with only four weeks to put this dinner together, we've shattered all the records. We raised $35.2 million tonight. Thank you. That's $35.2 million to grow our majority, and to fight for President Trump's agenda. I'm overwhelmed by your support, so let's defend our majority. Let's fight for working families. Let's back President Trump, and let's finish the job. God bless you, God bless President Trump, and God bless the United States. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 4 ( 39:33 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the chair of the House Republican Conference, Lisa McClain.

Lisa McClain ( 40:10 ):

I had to get my stool out. I may be little, but I play big. I don't know about you guys, but I am so excited to be here tonight. So, good evening and welcome, and thank all of you for all you do to defend our Republican majority. Keep growing. The majority does not happen without each and every one of your support. I want to especially thank the NRCC Chairman, Richard Hudson, and his team for all the incredible work they did to make tonight possible. Now, what we have done in the first three months of this Congress is actually remarkable, and you are a major part of what we are doing to make America great again. The two seats that we held last week in Florida are proof that the Republican Party are proving the naysayers wrong.

( 41:27 ) Now, think about it for one minute. Democrats spent $20 million to lose two seats in Florida by double digits. Two seats, they lost 20 grand. That's a victory for us. All the news cycles said, "Oh my goodness, Republicans are doomed." Seriously, look around. Give me a break. The two members will help us continue to be on offense and continue our offensive efforts. I mean, we gave Tom Emmer a huge victory on his majority, increasing it with those two seats. Gone are the days of making the House Republicans play defense. We are actually making the Democrats own their votes. They are holding fake town halls, making fun of Governor Abbott, and even threatened to deport the first lady and Elon Musk.

( 42:33 ) The Democrats have no plan, no vision, and definitely no leader. Every day, they become more out of touch hell-bent on fighting personalities, not policies, and why? Because we know our policies are winning. We will keep calling them out for their deranged behavior. Boy, they have a lot of that. The Democrats' self-destruction started when President Trump actually announced his re-election. Their 2024 campaign was supposed to be a referendum on his policies, and the American people wholeheartedly endorsed President Trump's policies. They delivered every single swing state along with the popular vote, and Democrats are melting down as President Trump keeps every single promise that he has made, like last week when he announced a historic change for our country.

( 43:39 ) For far too long as America has been taken advantage of, President Trump made it clear that we will no longer put American workers at an unfair disadvantage. He is leveling the playing field with the tariffs. He is making countries come to the table, our table. He is making countries invest in our country. He will make America respected again, and even the latest jobs report shows that our economy is back on track. Additionally, thanks to the president and his all-star cabinet, a legal border crossings are down 94%. Remember when Biden said he needed legislation to get that done? No. We just needed the right president at the helm to do the job that the American people want him to do, and we have already deported over 100,000 illegal aliens.

( 44:45 ) Now, while Democrats fight to protect murderers and rapists, the president is delivering on his promises to make America safe again by deporting violent criminals. Again, we signed the Laken Riley Act to the president's desk, and do you know what he did? That was the first bill that he signed in his second term. Thank you, Mike Collins, for bringing that piece of legislation to the floor in the House. Thank you President Trump for signing that bill. Thank you for Laken, and thank you for her family. For every family out there that has lost a loved one to illegal aliens who should have never been here to begin with, we will keep working with the president and his administration to deliver common sense wins, and gone are the days of biological men playing in biological women's sports.

( 45:50 ) Gone are the days of the DEI in our military. Gone are the days of anti-Semitism on our college campuses, and we will deliver the mandate that 77 million Americans asked us to do. We will avoid the largest tax cut in American history. We will lower costs, and make our country energy independent again. Unlike the Democrats, we know who our leader is, and that leader is President Donald J. Trump. He deserves the credit for expanding our tent. He deserves the credit for extending our base and expanding our brand. The Trump effect applies here too. President Trump has built some incredible coalitions, Black Americans, Arab Americans, Hispanic Americans. President Trump has proven that no matter your background, he wants you to become part of our party, to become part of our success story. In closing, I, again, want to thank all of you that you have contributed. You believe in us. You've contributed your time and your resources to our cause. As the president says, the golden age of America has only just begun. Our best days are still ahead of us, and I am confident that our president, our party, and our people are excited for what comes next. Thank you all, and enjoy your evening.

Speaker 4 ( 47:58 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back to the stage your Republican majority whip, Tom Emmer.

Tom Emmer ( 48:24 ):

Hello, fellow Republicans. No. Hello, fellow Republicans. Where are you? I know this is the cheap time you get to hear from me. Then you're going to get energy out of Steve Scalise, and you're going to get some energy out of our speaker Mike Johnson. But guess what? The show is Donald J. Trump, so get ready. We're just the warm-up band, if you will. Good evening, everyone. I know we are all ready for an exciting night as we hear from our 45th and our 47th president, Donald J. Trump. President Trump has been working at breakneck speed to undo the damage Joe Biden and Kamala Harris inflicted on our country over the past four years. In less than 100 days, he has delivered win after win after win for the American people, from stopping the invasion at our southern border to rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government and so much more.

( 49:25 ) One thing is very clear. America is back. Yeah, you should clap for that. America is back. The best part is we're just getting started. President Trump will renew the American dream, and usher in our country's golden age, but he needs our help to make it happen. On November 5th, President Trump earned over 77 million Americans' vote, and House Republicans, we earned over 74 million collectively. So, what does that mean? That means there are over 2 million voters out there who are not Republican or Democrat voters. They are Trump voters. We have a historic opportunity over the next 18 months to bring them firmly into the Republican camp, and we do that by delivering on President Trump's America first agenda that they voted for in Congress. That means continuing the president's wildly successful tax policy so he can unleash economic prosperity, and prevent a five-trillion-dollar tax hike.

( 50:38 ) It means giving the administration the tools it needs to carry out the largest deportation operation in American history to ensure there are no more stories like Laken Riley. It means empowering energy producers to drill baby drill, lowering prices for American families in the process. It means strengthening the world's greatest fighting force to uphold President Trump's policy of peace through strength. This is how we will cement our majority's place in history, and give us the message we need to take on the campaign trail next year. It's going to take every person in this room to get the job done, and I know that we will because failure is simply not an option. President Trump is counting on us. The American people are counting on us, and our friends in this room and grassroots supporters across the country are counting on us.

( 51:35 ) As we look to the next election cycle, we have to keep our eye on the ball. We cannot afford to be complacent. We have to outwork and out-fundraise Democrats. We are proud of the job Chairman Hudson did last cycle to protect our majority, and we're ready to continue working with him to not only protect it this time, but to grow our majority next year, because President Trump must have a strong House Republican majority to work with for all four years of his term. We have already seen the lengths Democrats are willing to go to try and stop the president when they hold an ounce of power in Washington. We remember the sham impeachments and the investigations that started after the 2018 midterms, and we know better than to ever let that happen again.

( 52:25 ) I'm proud to be a partner in this fight with all of you. Now, let's go get it done. Thank you. God bless President Trump, God bless America, and God bless all of you. Have a great night.

Speaker 4 ( 52:50 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome your leader of the House Republican Majority, Steve Scalise.

Steve Scalise ( 53:14 ):

All right, settle down, people. Settle down. We got a few things ahead of us. Wait until President Trump comes out. We've got the over under. If you've got your bingo cards, it's going to be a fun night. But look, the first thing I want to say is thank each and every one of you for what you did, number one, to help us keep the house majority, and what you're doing to help us grow this majority next year. Now, just think about it. It's not even been three months since Donald Trump took the oath of office, and what a difference three months makes. Just three months ago, the lunatics on the left said, "To save the planet, you've got to buy a Tesla." Today, the same lunatics on the left, "Get a Molotov cocktail. Light it on fire, and burn the Tesla." I thought they cared about carbon emissions. What about the carbon emissions?

( 54:07 ) You could drive a diesel truck for 30 years, and not emit as much carbon as lighting a Tesla on fire. These people have lost their mind. Now, the press says a lot right now about how the Democrat Party doesn't have a leader. Like most times, I beg to differ with the Washington Press. The Democrat Party has leaders. Their names are AOC, Bernie Sanders, Jasmine Crockett. Have you seen them? They are pushing the same Marxist ideology that brought people to the polls in record numbers to elect Donald Trump president, not just winning the electoral college, 77 million votes to win the popular vote to run the table in all seven swing states. The Democrats still won't admit why they lost, but we know.

( 55:03 ) We ran on real issues. We said we were going to go to work day one if we had the House, Senate, and White House working for those families who were struggling under Joe Biden's policies. What have we done? In just three months, we have already started fighting for those families. Border security was the number one issue in America, and look at what happened. In less than three months, illegal crossings are down 95%, because Donald Trump has done what he said he would do. If you look at energy production, and we're working on this one big beautiful bill, you're going to hear President Trump talk about that one big beautiful bill. This is the bill that will lock in tax rates, so we don't have a massive tax hike. That will allow us to produce more energy, reversing all the crazy Biden far-left policies to shut down American energy.

( 55:59 ) When you think about border security, yes, the president has already taken major steps to secure the border, but we still need to build the wall, and we're going to fund that in this bill. We're going to give our border patrol agents the tools they've been asking for for years, night vision goggles, drones, the things that drug cartels in Mexico has that we don't have. Why should the Mexican drug cartels have better technology and tools than our border patrol agents? That will change with House Republican leadership when we move this bill. On top of that, just look at Elon Musk. I mean, the left wants to demonize Elon Musk. All Elon Musk is doing is identifying the waste, fraud and abuse that we have all known has been out there in government. Tens of billions of dollars in every agency being wasted, thrown away.

( 56:54 ) Stacey Abrams given $2 billion to do who knows what, but that's all changing. What are the Democrats doing? You would think they would say, "You know what? They got us on that one. We'll work with Trump and Elon to root out waste, fraud and abuse." No, they are fighting that. There is a major party in America called the Democrat Party that is defending waste, fraud and abuse in Washington. You can't make this stuff up, but it doesn't end there. We identified before the election that about 75% of federal workers in Washington weren't even showing up for work. You have to show up for work. Our constituents have to show up for work. Yet, these bureaucrats were making over 100,000 a year not showing up for their jobs, and the job wasn't getting done, and President Trump day one said, "You better show up for work. Now, you don't have to, but if you don't, you lose your job."

( 57:50 ) Well, lo and behold, they all started finding their workplace not to work, but to protest. Look, what we have done with this majority in just three months is only the beginning when you see these policies start going into law. Trump's first week in office, we had the Laken Riley bill on his desk. We're putting two more on his desk this week to reverse some of the crazy financial regulations. When we get this big bill on his desk to lock in tax rates, to produce more energy, to secure the border, to lock in Doge savings and all the other things we're doing, including strengthening America's national defense, watch what happens to the economy and all the naysayers. The press will never be on our side. They'll never tout the winds, but this President Trump has come here on a mission.

( 58:48 ) I got to work with President Trump in the first term, and everybody watching knows this. They see a president more focused. They see a president more resolved than ever before to fight for those families who worked hard, showed up at the polls, and said, "We want Republicans in the House, Senate, and White House to save this great nation." We are just getting started. You've been there every step of the way with us. We're going to grow this majority. We just, by the way, got two more House Republicans last week, two elections in Florida. We won. Randy Fine and Jimmy Patronis are probably here tonight. Let's welcome our two new Republicans. We doubled our House Majority.

( 59:32 ) Think about this. I'm going to leave you on this note, because a lot of you, when you're donating money, you wonder about your return on investment. I want to just tell you our return on investment versus the Democrats. Last week, the Democrats spent $22 million, $22 million to lose those two seats in Florida by double digits. We spent less than $2 million to win those seats by double digits. That's a return on investment. That's why this is the best investment you can make in this House Republican Majority. Let's keep growing. Let's keep winning, and let's save the greatest country in the history of the world, the United States of America. God bless you. God bless our president. We're going to have a great night.

Speaker 4 ( 01:00:38 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please join us in welcoming the 56th speaker of the United States House of Representatives, Mike Johnson.

Mike Johnson ( 01:01:12 ):

Wow, thank you so much. Thank you. What a great crowd. What an extraordinary setting. I love this building. It always reminds me of the sound of music. It feels like we're in Austria or something. Really, really grateful to see all of you. I want to thank Chairman Richard Hudson. What a great leader he is for the NRCC and the entire team. A lot of gratitude to hand out tonight. I want to thank our entire house leadership team. I want to thank our extraordinary members. So many of them are joining us here tonight. Of course, most importantly, we want to thank all of you for making this possible this evening. This is a big one for us, and we shattered all the records. I promise you, we are going to be a good steward of those resources.

( 01:01:58 ) We have a big job ahead of us. We truly have a lot to be grateful for tonight, a lot to celebrate, not the least of which is this fact. I don't know if you've been following this, but we now officially have a seven-seat majority, ladies and gentlemen. Yes, I know. Do the math. It means that we can lose three votes now, and still pass a bill. It's an embarrassment of riches. I tell you, this job is so easy. This is our first week with our two newest members, and they were mentioned earlier, but Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine of Florida have joined us. Round of applause. With these two great new members, we have gained our number again. We're back to 220 Republicans, and every single one of them are fired up to advance the people's business, and to make America great again. Ladies and gentlemen, we simply would not be able to do this if it were not for two things, first, incredible support from leaders like all of you, and second, our 45th and our 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. That's a fact. Now, you all rolled your sleeves up this last cycle, and we worked around the clock to ensure that we kept the House Majority. Because we all worked so hard, we secured a unified Republican trifecta in Washington. Everybody said we couldn't do it. My friends, I mean, up to the evening before the election, they were riding our epitaph. They said that the Republican majority would go by the wayside. They said there were too many Republicans in Democrat territory last cycle, that the Democrats had too much money. They did raise a lot.

( 01:03:52 ) They said the Democrats redistricting was too much for us to overcome, but we didn't believe that. The leadership team and every member went to work. The NRCC refused to listen to all of that criticism. We got to work. We shored up our incumbents. We recruited incredible workhorses from coast to coast. Like so many of our members, I crisscrossed the country nonstop. I mean, almost literally every day we were not in session, I was on the road. I did over 360 campaign events, 250 cities in 40 states. I logged enough miles to circle the globe five and a half times. That's a real statistic. Some of you all know I was four inches taller when I became Speaker of the House. They beat me down mercilessly, but we all did that. All the members worked around the clock in overtime to get that done.

( 01:04:38 ) Along with our partners at CLF, the Congressional Leadership Fund, my team, we raised $332 million in 11 months to be able to do that. Many of you wrote the checks to make that possible. Thank you for that. Thank you. So, here's what happened, and the reason we're here tonight, the reason we're celebrating what we have achieved, and looking forward to the challenge ahead is because everybody got to work and made that happen. Our House Republicans defended our majority. We achieved the highest popular vote in history, and we flipped seats in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Colorado, and Alaska. Now, we're enacting a bold America First agenda to deliver on that mandate. We hit the ground running since January 3rd. We've been very busy. You've been watching this day by day.

( 01:05:26 ) We've been defying the odds. We've been making the critics be quiet. Just a small sample of the legislation we passed includes the Laken Riley Act, which is to save lives from the Biden border crisis, the Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act to defend Israel. We passed the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. That's right. We passed the Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, the HALT Fentanyl Act, the Protecting American Energy Production Act, and our government funding bill

Mike Johnson ( 01:06:00 ):

They put the Democrats on record for supporting a government shutdown and actually ignited a civil war, a political civil war, in their camp. Through it all, Republicans in Congress have stayed laser-focused on advancing common sense pro-growth policies, and the American people have taken note. Our party right now my friends enjoys record high levels of approval and today, more Americans believe the country's on the right track than at any point in the last 20 years, That's a big thing. In the weeks ahead, we're going to continue to hammer out the Budget Reconciliation Bill, which will be one of the most consequential pieces of legislation that Congress has passed in decades, and perhaps in the history of the Congress. Republicans here are committed to delivering President Trump's full America First agenda with that one big, beautiful bill, I'm not going to do it in his voice, okay.

( 01:06:57 ) We're going to make good on our promises. And what does that mean? We're going to secure the border, we're going to restore America's energy dominance, we're going to dismantle the deep state, we're going to grow our economy and reduce inflation, and we're going to turn America to peace through strength. House Republicans are moving full steam ahead to move the one big, beautiful bill across the finish line and on to the president's desk as quickly as possible. Through all this, we are also implementing our game plan for 2026, and this is what's important to everybody here. What you're investing in tonight is the plan that we're going to take into the field.

( 01:07:35 ) Our work over just the past months has broken the Democrat Party. While we are at record high approval levels, they are at record lows, they're negative 9% net approval in their own party right now, the Democrats in Congress. Their ideas are radical, their agenda was rejected, and their chances at a majority in 2024 were soundly defeated. Now they have no leader, no message, They have no vision for the country other than to double down on their failed terrible policies, and they're sending out their emerging new leaders like AOC and Bernie Sanders, That's where they are, right?

( 01:08:13 ) But we know that they will stop at nothing to get back in the majority in 2026, and if they were able to do that, my friends, heaven forbid, The President's agenda would come grinding to a halt after two years, we would see the return to open borders policies, we would see impeachments and corrupt law fare resurrected, and we would see the largest tax increase in American history. We cannot allow that to happen and the American people agree, and that's why tonight I have never been more confident and optimistic about the future of our party, our movement, and our country. The media loves to underestimate us, they love to be naysayers, but we have proven them wrong over and over again and we will continue to do so. I'm convinced that when we deliver on our agenda to this Congress, we will not only defy expectations but will defy history in 2026. It won't be easy, we're going to need every single one of you to get us over the finish line.

( 01:09:10 ) In the last election we saw a once in a generation demographic shift and I believe we're going to hold those voters, those new people that came into the party, and we now have a once in a generation opportunity to deliver on those promises. I'll close with this, all of this is not possible without the leadership of a great president. President Trump once delivered the greatest economy in the world and he will do it again with a little time and a Congress that helps him get there. President Trump once delivered a secure border and he has already delivered that again. President Trump once restored peace through strength, and he is already doing that again by bringing hostages home, supporting our allies like Israel, and getting our adversaries to the negotiating table. These are the reasons that we're so bullish about the historic moment that we are in right now. We're all in this together and President Donald J. Trump is leading the way. So tonight, we want to thank you all again for your support and your trust in us. I want to assure you that we will not let you down. God bless you for standing with us, We appreciate you so much.

( 01:17:42 ) This is a man's world.

( 01:17:42 ) This is a man's world, oh.

( 01:17:42 ) But it would be nothing.

( 01:17:42 ) Nothing, nothing, without a woman or a girl.

( 01:18:01 ) You see, man made the cars.

( 01:18:08 ) To take us over the road.

( 01:18:13 ) Man made the train.

( 01:18:13 ) To carry the heavy load.

( 01:18:24 ) Man made the electric lights.

( 01:18:24 ) To take us out of the dark.

( 01:18:24 ) Man made the boat for the water

( 01:18:24 ) And my Bible said Noah made the ark.

( 01:18:24 ) This is a man's world.

( 01:18:24 ) But it wouldn't be nothing.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.

( 01:18:24 ) (singing).

( 01:18:24 ) It's a man's world.

( 01:18:24 ) (singing).

( 01:18:24 ) Man thinks about our little bitty baby girls.

( 01:18:24 ) And our baby boys.

( 01:18:24 ) Man make them happy.

( 01:18:24 ) 'Cause man make them toys.

( 01:18:24 ) And after man make everything he can.

( 01:18:24 ) Man has the Lira, Pesos, Dollars, Rubles to buy up every good woman.

( 01:18:24 ) Every man.

( 01:18:24 ) This is a man's world.

( 01:18:24 ) (singing)

( 01:18:24 ) But would be nothing.

( 01:18:24 ) (singing).

( 01:18:24 ) Without a girl.

( 01:18:24 ) (singing).

( 01:18:24 ) He's lost.

( 01:18:24 ) [inaudible 01:20:55]

( 01:18:24 ) In the wilderness.

( 01:18:24 ) It's a man's world.

( 01:18:24 ) He's lost.

( 01:18:24 ) (singing).

( 01:18:24 ) In bitterness.

( 01:18:24 ) (singing).

( 01:18:24 ) This is a man's world, hey.

( 01:18:24 ) It's been seven hours and fifteen days.

( 01:18:24 ) Since you took your love away.

( 01:18:24 ) I go out every night and sleep all day.

( 01:18:24 ) Since you took your love away.

( 01:18:24 ) Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want.

( 01:18:24 ) I can see whomever I choose.

( 01:18:24 ) I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant.

( 01:18:24 ) But nothing.

( 01:18:24 ) I said nothing can take away these blues.

( 01:18:24 ) 'Cause nothing compares.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing compares to you.

( 01:18:24 ) It's been so lonely without you here.

( 01:18:24 ) Like a bird without a song.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling.

( 01:18:24 ) Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong?

( 01:18:24 ) I could put my arms around every boy I see.

( 01:18:24 ) But they'd only remind me of you.

( 01:18:24 ) I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?

( 01:18:24 ) Guess what he told me?

( 01:18:24 ) He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"

( 01:18:24 ) But he's a fool.

( 01:18:24 ) 'Cause nothing compares.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing compares to you.

( 01:18:24 ) All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard.

( 01:18:24 ) All died when you went away.

( 01:18:24 ) I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard.

( 01:18:24 ) But I'm willing to give it another try.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing compares.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing compares to you.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing compares.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing compares to you.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing compares.

( 01:18:24 ) Nothing compares to you.

( 01:18:24 ) Please, please, please, please.

( 01:18:24 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:24 ) Please, please, please.

( 01:18:24 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:24 ) Darling please, don't go, who.

( 01:18:24 ) Oh, yeah, oh.

( 01:18:24 ) I love you so.

( 01:18:24 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) Baby, you did me wrong.

( 01:18:27 ) You know you done me wrong.

( 01:18:27 ) Whoa, whoa, you done me wrong.

( 01:18:27 ) You know you done me wrong.

( 01:18:27 ) So you done-done me wrong, oh.

( 01:18:27 ) Whoa, oh yeah.

( 01:18:27 ) You took my love and now you're gone.

( 01:18:27 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) Please, please, please, please, please, please

( 01:18:27 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) Please, please, please,

( 01:18:27 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) Please, please.

( 01:18:27 ) Honey please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) Whoa, oh yeah.

( 01:18:27 ) Girl, I love you so.

( 01:18:27 ) Baby please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) I just wanna hear you say, I, I, I, I.

( 01:18:27 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) I, I, I, I.

( 01:18:27 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) Darling please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) Whoa, oh yeah.

( 01:18:27 ) Girl, I love you so.

( 01:18:27 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:27 ) Baby, take my hand.

( 01:18:31 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:31 ) I wanna be your, lovin' man.

( 01:18:31 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:18:31 ) Oh yeah, slipped outta my head.

( 01:18:31 ) Honey, please, don't go.

( 01:18:31 ) Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

( 01:24:14 ) I love you so.

( 01:24:14 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:24:14 ) Pleeeaaase, don't go.

( 01:24:14 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:24:14 ) Pleeeaaase, don't go.

( 01:24:14 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:24:14 ) Pleeeaaase, don't go.

( 01:24:14 ) Please, please don't go.

( 01:24:14 ) Honey, please don't go.

( 01:24:14 ) Well, I love you so.

( 01:24:14 ) Please, please, please, please don't go.

( 01:24:14 ) When I look into your eyes.

( 01:24:14 ) I can see a love restrained.

( 01:24:14 ) But darlin', when I hold you.

( 01:24:14 ) Don't you know I feel the same?

( 01:24:14 ) Yeah.

( 01:24:14 ) Nothin' lasts forever.

( 01:24:14 ) And we both know hearts can change.

( 01:24:14 ) And it's hard to hold a candle.

( 01:24:14 ) In the cold November rain.

( 01:24:14 ) We've been through this such a long, long time.

( 01:24:14 ) Just tryin' to kill the pain, ooh, yeah.

( 01:24:14 ) But lovers always come and lovers always go.

( 01:24:14 ) And no one's really sure who's lettin' it go today, walkin' away.

( 01:24:14 ) If we could take the time to lay it on the line.

( 01:24:14 ) I could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine, all mine.

( 01:24:14 ) So if you want to love me.

( 01:24:14 ) Then darlin', don't refrain.

( 01:24:14 ) Or I'll just end up walkin'.

( 01:24:14 ) In the cold November rain.

( 01:24:14 ) Do you need some time on your own?

( 01:24:14 ) Do you need some time all alone?

( 01:24:14 ) Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own.

( 01:24:14 ) Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

( 01:24:14 ) I know it's hard to keep an open heart.

( 01:24:14 ) When even friends seem out to harm you.

( 01:24:14 ) But if you could heal a broken heart.

( 01:24:14 ) Wouldn't time be out to charm you?

( 01:24:14 ) Whoa-oh, oh-oh-oh.

( 01:24:14 ) Sometimes, I need some time on my own.

( 01:24:14 ) Sometimes, I need some time all alone.

( 01:24:14 ) Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own.

( 01:24:14 ) Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?

( 01:24:14 ) And when your fears subside.

( 01:24:14 ) And shadows still remain, ooh, yeah.

( 01:24:14 ) I know that you can love me.

( 01:24:14 ) When there's no one left to blame.

( 01:24:14 ) So never mind the darkness.

( 01:24:14 ) We still can find a way.

( 01:24:14 ) 'Cause nothin' lasts forever.

( 01:24:14 ) Even cold November rain.

( 01:24:14 ) Don't you think that you need somebody?

( 01:24:14 ) Don't you think that you need someone?

( 01:24:14 ) Everybody needs somebody.

( 01:24:14 ) You're not the only one.

( 01:24:14 ) You're not the only one.

( 01:24:14 ) Don't you think that you need somebody?

( 01:24:14 ) Don't you think that you need someone?

( 01:24:14 ) Everybody needs somebody.

( 01:24:14 ) You're not the only one.

( 01:24:14 ) You're not the only one.

( 01:24:14 ) Don't you think that you need somebody?

( 01:24:14 ) Don't you think that you need someone?

( 01:24:14 ) Everybody needs somebody.

( 01:24:14 ) You're not the only one.

( 01:24:14 ) You're not the only one.

( 01:24:14 ) Don't you think that you need somebody?

( 01:24:14 ) Don't you think that you need someone?

( 01:24:14 ) Everybody needs somebody.

Speaker 34 ( 01:38:04 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 45th and the 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

MUSIC ( 01:38:14 ):

And I'm proud to be an American.

( 01:38:21 ) Where at least I know I'm free.

( 01:38:21 ) And I won't forget the men who died.

( 01:38:23 ) Who gave that right to me.

( 01:38:34 ) And I'd gladly stand up next to you.

( 01:38:42 ) And defend Her still today.

( 01:38:42 ) 'Cause there ain't no doubt.

( 01:38:42 ) I love this land.

( 01:38:42 ) God Bless the U.S.A.

( 01:38:54 ) From the lakes of Minnesota.

( 01:38:57 ) To the hills of Tennessee.

MUSIC ( 01:39:01 ):

Across the plains of Texas, from sea to shining sea, from Detroit down to Houston and New York to L.A. where there's pride in every American heart and it's time we stand and say that I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free.

( 01:39:19 ) And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me.

( 01:39:19 ) And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today because there ain't no doubt I love this land.

( 01:39:19 ) Love this land.

( 01:39:19 ) God bless the USA.

( 01:39:19 ) And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm free and I won't forget the men who died who gave that life to me, and I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today because there ain't no doubt I love this land.

( 01:39:19 ) Love this land.

( 01:39:19 ) God bless the USA.

Donald Trump ( 01:40:37 ):

Well, thank you very much. This is a great room and we've done very well in this room before, but right now, we broke every record. I just heard from Mike Johnson. He said, we broke every record, sir. They raised over $35 million. That's not bad for an evening. For an evening that's not bad. I wonder if you ever turned the room this way. You know it's interesting because I love real estate. I love ballrooms. Have nice ballrooms, a lot of them. I wonder if they ever turned it this way instead so it might be interesting. This way I'm not talking to a wall. They think they get a better view, but actually I'm not sure, but next time, maybe we'll have to worry about that next year where we'll do 45 or 50 million, right?

( 01:41:25 ) A lot of people, you broke your record attendance and you broke your money record, and that's a great tribute to the Republicans and the party and everything it stands for. It's wonderful and I want to thank especially Speaker Mike Johnson because he's been incredible and we have some unbelievable supporters of our house, Republican majority with us as you know. And with the help of everyone in this room, the next year's Republican Party is going to defy history. We're going to really defy it and we already are. We're getting things done. It's going to be very interesting to see. It's going to be a very interesting year. We have an interesting time. We're making a fortune with tariffs. $2 billion a day. Do you believe it? I was told $2 billion a day.

( 01:42:13 ) I get hit by the press about tariffs. We're making 2 billion, billion. This isn't 35 million. That's peanuts. $2 billion a day. And then they say, gee, they don't know. This is only the enemy can be talking this way. In addition, we have a lot of countries coming to see us. They want to make a deal and we're doing things that nobody's ever even thought about doing. And we're going to defeat the radical left Democrats who are out there complaining about everything. All they do is complain and then they want to put men in women's sports and things like that. They want men in women's sports. They're still fighting for that. I saw this poor guy, you all know him. I won't mention his name. He's sort of a nice guy. He's a loser. He's a Democrat, but he's a… And he was fighting on a big show this morning.

( 01:43:03 ) "We got to have that. It's not fair that essentially that men aren't allowed to compete against women." Can you believe this guy? But let them do it. I say we shouldn't be fighting a lot of these things. Just let them go and then just before the next election, we'll unleash on them because it would be very sad if they actually changed their policies. We don't want that to happen. But we're going to win the midterm elections and we're going to have a tremendous thundering landslide. I really believe that. And it's so important that we pass a big beautiful bill because that's going to be… And I really think we're helped a lot by the tariff situation that's going on, which is a good situation, not a bad. It's great. It's going to be legendary. You watch. Legendary in a positive way I have to say. It's going to be legendary.

( 01:43:52 ) But I really think it actually puts pressure on those few Republicans that who just can't get there. You know what the alternative is, a Democrat bill or a chapter for the… We have the debt continuation and they have to do this. They have to get there. And I think we are there. We had a great meeting today. I think we are there, but just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there, you just got to get there, close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding. Just stop grandstanding. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. You know their policy, the Democrats is horrible. It's horrible. Think of it, open borders, just all of the horrible, stupid things they have.

( 01:44:42 ) You don't have energy, you don't have anything. They've lost their confidence. Everything is bad. But the one thing they always vote in unison. You don't see somebody that's holding up, "I'm going to hold up." And the alternative is hell. The alternative is hell. So the Republicans, just that one little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote. If you're a single guy or a second guy and you fight like hell for what you get, and then in the end you have to vote because the policy is phenomenal. They don't get every little ounce. Doesn't work that way. And this bill that we're working on now is the best I think we've ever passed.

( 01:45:24 ) Mike, wherever you may be, I think it's the best thing we've… We'll get it passed, but I think it's going to be the most important thing we've ever passed. It's the best thing we've ever passed. And I do think that the war with the world, which is not a war at all because they're all coming here. Japan is coming here as we speak. They're in a plane flying, lots of them, all tough negotiators. But things that people wouldn't have given us two years ago, wouldn't have even thought of it two years ago, three years ago, five years ago, seven, they've given us everything. They don't want tariffs on themselves. And it's very simple. We're making deals and people are paying tariffs. Countries are paying tariffs. Right now China's paying a 104% tariff. Think of it, 104%.

( 01:46:13 ) Now it sounds ridiculous, but they charged us for many items 100%, 125%. Many countries have, they've ripped us off left and right, but now it's our turn to do the ripping. That's okay. We're going to make our country even stronger, stronger than it ever was. In 2026 Republicans will fight for every state, every seat, and every single vote. We're going to fight like hell. I intend to personally campaign for candidates all across the country and we just won't… You're right about that. We won't just keep our majorities. We want to expand our majorities by a lot. There's this thing about midterm elections that you have a president and the president… They never seem to win. I don't understand. They never seem to win the midterm elections and I have no idea why. We're not going to let that be a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have no idea why. We're setting records right now.

( 01:47:14 ) We're getting more things approved than any President has ever done in the first a hundred days. It's not even close. I had somebody say the most successful month, first month in the history. Now they said the most successful hundred days in the history of our country. And I believe that's right. And we're going to continue that way if not more so. And we're going to do tremendously in midterms. There's no reason… We should do great in the midterms. There's this thing that for some reason, the president, whoever the president is, the midterms are tough. Why would they be tough? If we're doing great, they should be easy. And I'm telling you, we got to win a lot more. But as Mike said before, I happened to listen to him. He was on C-SPAN 1. That's a big upgrade, right? I was listening as I was putting on the tie.

( 01:48:03 ) How does it look? He was on C-SPAN 1. And they were talking about that. And I thought to myself, because people love him and they love your leaders, they love… Really the party is just doing well. A couple we could do without to be honest with you but… But the party is doing well and there's no reason we shouldn't just get together and win these midterms and win them by a lot. Because seven, that I heard Mike talking about before, seven is not really enough. But we lived for one for a period of time. The only thing good about seven, when you have one and now all of a sudden you have seven, it sounds like… It's like a landslide. It's so good.

( 01:48:43 ) It's like the most amazing thing. Seven sounds so good when I hear that. It sounds like we can't be beaten and we should be 50, 60 up. Honestly, we should be a hundred up because based on policy, these people have the worst policy that anybody's ever seen. There's something wrong with them. Honestly, there's something wrong with them. All this crap. 13 house Democrats currently represent districts that voted for Trump and voted for Trump big. And in 2026 we're going to tell them, all 13 that you're fired. Get out, out, get out.

( 01:49:22 ) No reason for that. 13, but 13 is a small number compared to some of these stats. We are going to work very hard. I'm going to do telerallies. You know, telerallies. I'll do rallies for a lot of you, but I'll do telerallies at a minimum. And we just had two great elections by the way, and I heard everybody is introducing our two new Congress. Where are they? Please stand up. I want to look you in the eye. I want to look you in the eye, Randy. Look at them. Two of them. Where's… What a job you did, man. You were never in doubt. Where the hell… Where's our second person here? I know he's… Oh, there he is. Boy, they gave him a lousy seat. He's behind… Good. Great job. We're proud of you, man. Great job. Great job. Thank you.

( 01:50:11 ) And those, both elections, they were saying, "It's going to be close, it's going to be close." And I was listening and they won by like… You won by what, 17 points, 18 points. I don't think that's close. I don't think it's close. So we won by a 15 and 18 points and they're saying it was a terrible evening for Trump. Can you believe it? Terrible evening. They were only won by 18 points and 15 points. Anyway, good job both of you. Good job. But in addition to our fantastic house speaker, we're pleased to be joined by Majority leader Steve Scalise. And I watched you too, Steve. I watched you on C-SPAN 1. And Steve has suffered greatly. I mean I was there the night that it looked like he wasn't going to make it. He's very brave. He suffered greatly.

( 01:51:04 ) And I tell the story about the baseball game where… I mean he was really… The doctor told me, "Sir, I've never had anybody lose so much blood. It's not looking good." And his wife loved him. She was such a disaster that night. She was crying. She was crying. Because I'd been with people that were in serious trouble and the wives couldn't care. They couldn't care less. In fact, after they recovered, I said, "Do yourself a favor, get rid of the wife." No, I'm only kidding. Of course. I'm only kidding. I like to say I'm only kidding that way that cleans it up a little bit for the press. I say I was only kidding.

( 01:51:42 ) No, I've seen some wives that were truly not bothered too much. I had one where the dog died and the husband died on the same day. And I said, "It's too bad about Harry." "No, no, but Lucy died." Lucy. Oh my God. Harry didn't mean… He left her a fortune too. Can you believe it? Harry didn't matter. The dog mattered a lot. But I was with Steven and he was really… That was a tough thing. And then amazingly, he was… Like a year later he was in the baseball game against the Democrats and he's playing second base and he was having a hard time. It's a hard time getting around and with his luck, a shot was hit to him on the ground, a ground ball, and he got down and that ball was… No way that ball was…

( 01:52:25 ) It was right at him but really it was whacked. I don't know who the hell hit it. It looked like a major league ground ball. And Steve went down and blocked that sucker and got on his knees and threw it to first base. It was the most unbelievable thing that it could happen. This was God… This was God watching a game. I'm telling you. Does everybody remember that? He blocked it, knocked the hell out of his foot. Not his glove, it was his foot. And he got down and grabbed the ball, threw it out, and got the runner by quite a bit. And they then took him out of the game and I said, what a great move. That was a good manager. They took him out of the game because you can't improve on that, let me tell you.

( 01:53:07 ) But he had great courage and amazing how he's done and he's been very special and all of us know it. He's really done great. Another man I've really gotten to know a lot, and I think he's fantastic is Tom Emmer, Majority Whip. I think he's fantastic. Where's Tom? Where's Tom? Where is our Tom? Because I want to see his wife. You know his wife is better than him. She… He admits it. Oh, that's good. Hi Tom. So where is she, Tom? Oh no, she's not here. She's home. She's watching C-SPAN. Yeah, I know. Thank you Tom. Great job you do. And Lisa, you were up talking about Donald Trump tonight and Lisa McClain, conference chair, she was talking about Trump and I appreciate it, Lisa. Lisa. Where are you, Lisa? She's like a roast. Thank you, darling. I saw [inaudible 01:54:07] whole speech. I watched you and Steve and Mike.

( 01:54:09 ) I watched the whole thing. Then they said, "Sir, we have to leave. You're going to be late." I said, "I want to watch your speeches." And we have Richard Hudson, the NRCC chairman who set the record tonight. Richard, great going. That's a great job and Brian Jack, who was with me from day one of my political career. He was so fantastic. He was so fantastic. And he came to me, he said, "Do you think it would be okay?" He wanted to run for Congress. He always wanted to run for Congress. It was the most important thing. But he was with me, know so much about politics and boxing. He knows a lot about boxing too, but he loves politics. But he really just wanted to run. I think his ambition was to be a congressman.

( 01:54:54 ) And the seat came due. A good member of Congress actually retired and Brian… In Georgia. And Brian said, "What do you think, sir?" I said, "Well, you got my endorsement." And he won by a lot and he's never looked back. He's a fantastic guy and a great political leader, a great politician. Brian Jack. Where are you, Brian? Where are you Brian? Hi Brian. Great job. Proud of you, Brian. And more than 160 members of Congress, and I'd like to really… You've done incredibly well. They're really looking back and I said before, the Democrats have taken a lot of beatings. They have lost their confidence. They've gone crazy. They've gone crazy. How about this new one they have? Their new star Crockett. How about her?

( 01:55:48 ) Is that real? Are they serious about that? That's their new star. If that's their new star, they are in serious trouble. I mean, this is Crockett. Oh man, oh man. But we've done a job, but they've totally lost their confidence and it's a hard thing when you lose your confidence. But they have. They've taken a lot of beatings and now they're going to rely on Crockett to bring them back. Crockett's going to bring them back. You ever watched this. Last November all the leaders here tonight we're given a mandate from the American people and at the presidential level, we won. Think of this, all seven swing states. We won the electoral college 312 to 226. That's not bad. Remember. The fake news was saying it's going to be tough because people like Trump… But he should be able to get 270.

( 01:56:39 ) I actually went to Nebraska and campaigned for one vote. I went to New Hampshire, I campaigned. Because they said that it could be we're 270, 269. So I'm going to all the places and I'm trying to get one. We won Nebraska big, but there was one area and I went there. I went all over the place campaigning, and then we get 312. But we won in a landslide too because we won the popular vote for the first time of a Republican in decades. And now I think that's going to be done routinely. We won 85% of all counties in America, 525 for them, and 2,725 for us. That's that map that you see. It's all red except for the two corners. Have a little blue, a little line of blue. For the first time in history, all 50 states shifted toward the Republican Party. First time in history it's never happened. It's a shift. It shifted Republican. And today there are more registered Republicans at any time in the history of our country. How good. How about that?

( 01:57:48 ) Meanwhile, approval ratings for the Democrat party have plunged to the lowest level ever recorded. They're at 26%. So you tell me about the midterms, right? 26, the lowest level ever for either party. The Republican Party is a much bigger party now than it was ever before. And I must say that it's the biggest now since you heard the name Donald J. Trump running as a politician. You heard the name before, but not as a politician. I said to my wife, "I think I'm going to do this thing. Do I have your approval?" "Yes, darling. I think you'll win." See, she's a supportive first lady. I don't know if she believed it or not, but she said it. She said, "Yes, darling, I think you'll win." "How do you think I'll do?" "Oh darling, you'll win very easily." Even though I've never done it before. I said, "I have one problem. I've never done it before."

( 01:58:40 ) She said, "That doesn't matter. You're so talented." I said, "Thank you very much." This is why do we get along. It's easy to get along like that. But we have far more people and far more enthusiasm than the party's ever had. I think I could almost say than any party's ever had. I don't think any party's ever had more enthusiasm than us and spirit. A lot of that's our leadership. The Democrats are a broken party with bad policy. They've lost so much, and both as politicians and as people, they've lost the stages set for a monumental victory for the Republicans in the midterms. And many of you, I guess most of you, so many great congressmen and women here, you got some senators here also, but many of you are… All of you are up. We've got to win, got to work really hard and we got to win because there's no way they should be winning based on policy, and it's ultimately about policy.

( 01:59:40 ) We simply have to keep our promises to the people, and we have to very simply put America first. Put America first. And I said, I ran on common sense, you know. I ran on… It sounds like a phrase that would've been used. I don't know. Nobody tells me it was used in politics before. Now everybody's used it. I see the Democrats, some Democrat guy was just real sleazeball. Got up. He said, "Yeah, I ran on common sense. That's what I did. Common sense. Yeah." And I said, "[inaudible 02:00:11] but the problem in politics, you come up with a little slogan and they copy it." But you know they copied no tax on tips. Remember, I said no tax on tips. Nevada hadn't been won for many years by a Republican and state of Nevada… And don't ever call it Nevada. You'll lose 25%. Call it Nevada. It's true.

( 02:00:35 ) It sees almost nicer the other way. Nevada sounds like Brooklyn. Does that make sense? I come from Nevada, but don't ever call it Nevada. Call it Nevada. But as you know, the corrupt globalist establishment that ruled our country for decades is now complaining that I'm doing exactly what I pledged to do in the campaign. All of these things, tariffs, the men in women's sports, everything, the borders, strong borders. We have the strongest border we've ever had today. It was just announced. Strongest border. They don't want to write that. They forget. They forget. Eggs. I came in eggs, not a very glamorous thing to talk, but eggs. I was in for one week and they said, "Egg prices are soaring." I said, " I've just been here. I didn't know this, please." I didn't know it. The fake news. They're going, "Egg prices are soaring."

( 02:01:37 ) I said, "Man, I just got here. Let me know about it. What's going on with eggs? Tell me." So they gave me a little bit of a thing, and it's true. Under Biden, they soared like double, triple, quadruple. You couldn't even get them. They were not available. They said don't use eggs for Easter. Use the plastic, alternative plastic. At Mar- a-Lago we got plastic eggs all over the place. They said, don't use it for Easter for… If you're doing an Easter egg hunt, do not use eggs. Well, we have a wonderful Secretary of Agriculture, as you know, Brooke Rollins. She's here someplace I think, and she went after it. When she goes after something, we don't play games, right, Brooke? And eggs, egg prices are down now 87% and you have all the eggs you want. 87%. And they didn't write about it. They don't talk about it.

( 02:02:37 ) I go up, I make speeches about eggs all the time. I never get a report or writing about it because we were successful. If you're a Republican, when you're successful on something, you have to toot your own horn. Talk about it because you're the only one that's going to. It's a pretty rough… It's a rough business, I will tell you. But the shrill voices that you're hearing this week about tariffs are the same scoundrels and frauds who never thought twice about when the United States lost 90,000 factories and plants. Think of that. 90,000. How do you do 90? If you had a map, a big map, the size of that wall, and you had a pin for each factory, you wouldn't have enough room. You think of it, 90,000 factories since NAFTA. The worst trade deal in history, by the way. And we had it terminated. Everybody said you'd never be able to. It had to be terminated by Congress and it was not easy.

( 02:03:31 ) It was so bad. The people have a lot of… It's very interesting. They have a lot of power. They have a lot of political power. It's hard to get even a bad deal terminated. But we did do it and we got USMCA, and that's been really great. But when they cheat, it's not so good. And they cheat. They do cheat. I respect Mexico, I respect Canada, but they cheat like hell. Canada charges for our dairy products, 270%. Nobody knows that. They charge you 2% for the first two cartons of milk. And after that, you go up to 270 and the press says they've only charged 2%. No, that's for the first two cartons. You know, we can't have that and we have to be wise to it and get along with everybody, but we have to call people out.

( 02:04:21 ) 6 million manufacturing jobs were lost since NAFTA when 21 million illegal aliens brought across our borders. Think of that. Many of whom were violent criminals, murderers, drug lords, and the mentally insane. Insane asylums were closed. They used to go crazy when I talk about Hannibal Lecter, the late great Hannibal Lecter, right? Silence of the Lambs. The fake news would say, "Why does he talk about that? He's a fictional character." He's actually not. We have many of them that came across the border. It's actually not. But when the people went to the voting booth, then we understood why he talked about that because they voted for us. They said we don't want Hannibal Lecter in our country. The great Hannibal Lecter.

( 02:05:05 ) He was a very important force. But the press would go absolutely crazy if I mentioned Hannibal Lecter's name because they said he's a fictional character. Now, but it was making a point. And the point is, they're emptying mental institutions and insane asylum. Not anymore, they're not. Insane asylums into our country. We had numbers, the likes of which nobody's ever seen anything like it. Other countries, I deal with other countries all the time. I am right now on tariffs where they want to make a deal with us. We don't necessarily want to make a deal with them. We're happy the way we are taking our $2 billion a day, but they want to make a deal with us. And they talk about it and they say, "We cannot believe that they had open borders." These are countries. They have borders and they don't let people into their country.

( 02:05:55 ) They can't understand how. They did it because they're sick or they're crazy. There's something really wrong with these people. But the same people now telling me about how to deal with China are the ones who sold out America for decades to China. For decades they gave up to China. I'm the only one that… You know how much… China's paid almost $700 billion in tariffs under me. And then they say, "Donald Trump hasn't been tough on China." They say Trump hasn't been tough on Russia. Okay, here's the story. Nord Stream 2, did anybody ever hear of it? It's the biggest pipeline in the world. I closed it. Russia had it. I closed it. Putin told me, "That's the worst thing. You're supposed to be friendly with me. I'd hate to see you as my enemy." I closed Nord Stream 2. When Biden got in, he opened it up immediately.

( 02:06:46 ) It serviced all of Europe going to Germany. It serviced all of Europe. We closed it. And they say, "Oh, he wasn't tough on Russia." I was very tough with the sanctions and everything else. And by the way, just for your information, we're trying like hell to get the fighting stopped between Russia and Ukraine. A thing that never would've happened if the election wasn't rigged. We had a rigged election and we can say it and say it loud and say it proud because the election was rigged and we can't let that stuff happen anymore. Go to paper ballots. Go to same-day voting, go to voter ID, go to citizenship. You have to prove your citizenship, a little piece of paper and you won't have it. Sort of disappointing because a lot of Republican governors, they could do that. Same-day voting, paper ballots. Very sophisticated paper actually.

( 02:07:35 ) It's all watermarked. You can't cheat. Very hard to cheat. France went that way. They were like us, and they were having very bad elections, very crooked elections. They had 37 million people. They voted. They had a winner, they had a loser. They went home. That was it. 10 o'clock in the evening was over. With us you ever see, we have these machines that cost a fortune and they say, "We think we're going to have the final vote tally in two and a half weeks." And wait a minute, this is election day. You ever see where in California they were counting votes four weeks later. And then they say… And by the way, all paper costs 8% of the machines. Why is it that Republican governors aren't going to it, okay? What's going on with our Republican governors? If nothing else you say, even if it was just the same.

( 02:08:26 ) And it's not. Nothing's foolproof when it comes to voting, but it's pretty close. But it costs 8%. In other words, you can have your election 8% the cost of the machines, and you get an accurate count. So it's pretty amazing. They gave us NAFTA, mass illegal immigration, the Democrats did. The fake Paris Climate Accord and the China's entry into the World Trade Organization. That was a wonderful day for us. China entered the world trade. They've done pretty good. And they didn't do things exactly by the books. And they were a developing nation. They still are. They say, "We are a developing nation. We should be entitled to more." And our people say, "Oh, that's right. They're developing." They're not developing. We're developing. Look at some of our inner cities. We got to develop them, but we can't let the Democrats get away with this stuff.

( 02:09:26 ) But we are developing more than they are. The globalists have been wrong about everything. And so I wear their attack on me because nobody has ever been attacked like a man named Donald J. Trump. In the history of our country nobody's ever, but I wear it as a badge of honor. Nobody has ever been attacked. I was under more investigations than the late great Al Capone. He was the most violent criminal. He was the most violent mob boss in history. And I was under investigation far more than him. It wasn't even close. Our opponents are not afraid that our America first policies will fail. They're terrified that our strategy will succeed, and we're going to get bigger and stronger and better as a party. And that's what's happening. And that is what's happening. It's going to be something. And I'm actually looking forward to the midterms. I really are.

( 02:10:20 ) We're going to prove that all of their treasonous years of betrayal will not be forgotten because it's treason. What they did is treason. When they allowed millions of people to pour in through open borders from all over the world that came. To me that's treason. What they've done to our country is unthinkable. The money we have to spend to take people out. And then we have judges that say, no, let Tren de Aragua come back into our country. They want him to come back in. Killers. They cut off a man's fingers because he… "Did you cut off… Did you, sir, make a phone call to the police in Colorado?" " Yes, I did. I did." "You've attacked us and you've taken over our building." They took over real estate all over Colorado." You did, right? Give me your hand." Put the hand down. Boom. Cuts off his fingers and they want him back.

( 02:11:17 ) And how about the mix-up with the MS-13 where it wasn't a Tren de Aragua, it was an MS-13 killer, and they said, "Oh, they got him mixed up. Let's get them back into our country." No, we need people that are going to love our country. I'm proud to be the president for the workers, not the outsourcers. The president who stands up from Main Street, not Wall Street, who protects the middle class, not the political class, and who defends America, not trade cheaters all over the globe. They're trade cheaters. They cheated on us. They cheated with tariffs on us. They stole our money, they stole our jobs. And now people are going around saying, "Oh, we're not treating

Donald Trump ( 02:12:00 ):

… treating them right now. We're treating them very good, actually. They're lucky we're treating them so good. And when I have tariffs and I say, "Well, we're going to charge what they did, we're going to charge what they did." And then I say, "I'm going to charge much less than they did." Believe me, we're actually being nice about it. But we're doing very well, better than we've ever done before. My job is not to maximize the profits of outsources and foreign car… These foreign corporations are horrible. It's horrible, what they're doing. But we're catching them. We're catching them by the dozens. I have to defend the American Dream, and I have to defend the American citizens, that's my job. I have to defend that. The American Dream is never mentioned. It was mentioned for four years and now it's being mentioned again, but it was never mentioned when we had Sleepy Joe in office.

( 02:12:54 ) I used to have a big… The hardest thing I had to do with Joe Biden is the nickname. Do I call him Sleepy Joe or Crooked Joe? Could we take a vote, please? Who wants to call him Crooked Joe? Who wants to call him Sleepy Joe? That's my problem, it's like the same. They both work. They both work beautifully. Joe had one ability that I didn't have. He said he was a good golfer, he's terrible. Somebody said the only time I got angry during our debate when he said he was a six-handicap. He's not a six, he's not a 36, okay?

( 02:13:35 ) But he had one ability that I don't have. He was able to go to a beach, bathing suit in tow. Because it looked like it was actually falling off. But he'd go, had a hard time walking through the sand, because sand is heavy on your feet, carrying one of those six-ounce chairs that are made out of aluminum that if you weigh a little bit too much, it just cracks in the middle when you sit down, and he could sit down in a beach with photographers on the beach. He's the president, so he had a minimum of photographers, but he still had photographers. And he could fall asleep. Who the hell could do that? Who could fall asleep? And he'd turn around and drool would be coming out. He didn't care, his wife didn't care.

( 02:14:20 ) I could never fall asleep under those circumstances. I'd be very conscious of my body and what we look like. I'd be sitting up like this. Then I'd say, "Darling, it's time to go. Let's get out of here." Well, wouldn't most people? This guy could go to the beach and he was out in seconds. Guys are shooting him, he'd be in the papers the next day, eyes closed, mouth open.

( 02:14:50 ) The United States has been getting ripped off for 50 years, and we're simply not going to take it anymore, and that's what's happening right now. In 1950, the United States dominated global auto production, producing more than 75% of all of the cars on Earth. Think of that, 75%, and even higher before that. Today we produce 11%, while China produces three times more than we do. Let me tell you something. With the tariffs that we're doing, as you know, we have tariffs on automobiles, aluminum, steel, separate from the other tariffs, the baseline, we call it, companies are pouring back into our country with plants. There's a run on sites, there's a run on old plants. Most of them are being ripped down for new plants. They've stopped building, in Mexico, four or five plants, and they're all coming into the United States. I know what the hell I'm doing. I know what I'm doing. And you know what I'm doing, too. That's why you vote for me.

( 02:15:56 ) And the chip makers are coming in. They're all coming in. We've never had anything like this. We have investment, they think, of about, think of this, $7 trillion, and that's been in a month and a half. Think of that. You got to give me a little time to get warmed up with that. So, let's take the first couple of weeks off. For about a month and a half, we got almost $7 trillion spoken for, trillion. We've never had that. I don't know if we've ever had it at anytime, but if you go back and look at Biden and these other campaigns, any of them, they didn't have those numbers for the year. These are the biggest chip makers in the world, the biggest auto manufacturers in the world. $7 trillion of investment. And that means jobs. I look at differently, not investment, I look at it as jobs, and they're coming in at levels that we've never seen before.

( 02:16:53 ) And it is true that Mexico, they've stopped building plants, and those plants are now going to be built in the United States of America. So, it's pretty exciting. All because of two things. They say they want to be nice to me. They say, "Sir, because of November 5th, the election, and because of tariffs." I said, "In that order?" And the smart ones say, "Yes, sir. First was that you got elected and second was tariffs." And I'll accept that. But I will tell you, because of tariffs. But I'm the only one that would've done the tariffs, because everybody was afraid. They were afraid of being criticized, because the globalists will go after you.

( 02:17:29 ) For seven decades, American ships have patrolled the seas, American troops have kept the pace and peace, and American wealth has enriched the globe. But despite all we have given to them, you will not find an American car in Berlin and Tokyo, in Seoul and Shanghai. Not a car. I used to say to Angela Merkel, "Angela, how many Chevrolets do we have in Berlin?" "Why, none, Donald. None." "That's right, Angela, you got it. How many Chevrolets do you think we have in Munich, Angela?" "None, Donald." I said, "You sent us 7 million cars last year." So, we're going to start buying American-made cars or cars that are manufactured in America.

( 02:18:16 ) And if you can do it, not part of what I was going to say, but one of the best things that I think I've come up with is interest deductions. If you buy a car that's made in America, you get an interest deduction on the money you borrow, and I love it. I hope you can do it, Mike. I hope you can do it, because I haven't bugged you about that. I've been talking about no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, and I haven't really been as strong on this one, but it's only because it gets a little bit long, you know? But if you think of it, you buy a car, you borrow money, and you get a deduction on that money if the car is made in America. That will not cost you 10 cents, you'll make money with that one. I think you'll make money actually in a certain way with the other three also. I think they're very important, and they were part of our campaign.

( 02:19:06 ) I was going to say before that in Nevada, that when I came up with the no tax on tips, I think that's why we won by a massive amount. And interestingly, they came up about a month and a half later, she was making one of her few speeches. She didn't speak too much for a reason. Good reason. She's making a speech, and in the middle she said, "Oh, and by the way, we will have…" And everyone's falling asleep. "We will have no tax on tips." That place booed the hell out of it. They said, "You're a little late on that one." Because I was worried they'd copy me, it was so good.

( 02:19:42 ) You know how it actually happened? Maybe I should tell the story quickly. I was in my building in Las Vegas, we have a great restaurant there. And this young, beautiful waitress, and you're not allowed to say beautiful because that's the end of your political career. If you call a young woman beautiful, that's the end of your career. But what the hell? She was beautiful. So, she came up to me and she said, "Hello, sir. So nice to have you at the hotel." I said thank you. I had a group of people, some political people, actually. It was very interesting.

( 02:20:11 ) And I said, "How's everything going?" She said, "Oh, it's so tough. They're after my tips." "Who's after?" "The government. They're after my tips, constantly after my tips. They're after all of us for the tips." She said, "Sir, we should have no tax on tips." I said, "Say it again, what?" "We should have no tax." She said it. This was my consultant, a waitress from my hotel. Most people go out and spend millions of dollars to come up with an idea. I said, "She just said no tax on tips. That's the coolest thing I've ever heard."

( 02:20:43 ) So I went outside, there were a lot of… We finished our wonderful meal, steak, went outside, and there were a lot of cameras, as there always are, unfortunately. I said, "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to have a new policy all over the country, but specifically in Nevada. There will be no tax on tips." Right? And the cameras went wild, click, click, click, click, click. And we won the state by a lot. So, I don't know. So, I have to find that waitress and thank her. She was my consultant, except I didn't pay her $2 million like the other consultants that we all get screwed by.

( 02:21:23 ) Even worse than the tariffs other countries impose are the non-monetary barriers. That's a non-monetary, these are not financial, these are other things, what they do, so that you can't get your product in that country. And China, as you know, is one of the bigger offenders. And it's not all China. Look, I get along with President Xi, I have over the years, but you just… When COVID came, that was the end. That was it. That was called a bridge too far. But I've always had a good relationship with a very smart guy. Loves his country, I love our country, so we love our country, he loves his. I tell that to other leaders, you got to fight for your country. You're not going to fight for us, but we can't fight for you. We're fighting for other countries. We're trying to make them great without making us great, but those days are over.

( 02:22:14 ) They steal our intellectual property. They rob our trade secrets. They manipulate their currency to levels that have never been seen before. Today it was announced that China is reducing its currency. Did you see that? Big, big. In other words, they're going to make up for it. They got every trick in the book. I'll tell you, they are great. You got to hand it to them. You got to hand it to them. They're manipulating their currency today as an offset against the tariffs. Not supposed to do that. The game isn't supposed to be played that way. Makes it very hard for us.

( 02:22:48 ) But in the end it's not good because they have to buy oil. See, we don't need oil. We don't need oil and gas, we have more than any other country. They have to buy it. That's where it hurts them, when they do that, it costs them twice as much. And they ship their products through every one of our trading partners, running up our deficits with these countries. They sell a lot. You know when you put a tariff on them, they sell it, like with steel. They were dumping tremendous amounts of steel into our country. During my term, I saved every steel mill. We only have steel mills because of what I did. I put a high tariff on them, 25 and then 50%, and it stopped. It stopped. They were dumping so much steel, we would've lost every single steel mill. The people that like me best are the people in the steel business, but I think the auto business is going to be right there. I think chips are going to be there.

( 02:23:42 ) I think pharmaceuticals are going to be there, because we don't make our own pharmaceuticals, drugs, and other things to get better. They're made in other countries. And you pay a number of… The same package in our country compared to London and other places is sometimes 10 times more, 10 times more. Something that sells for $88 in London sells for $1,300 here, made in the same factory by the same company. And that's over. I told them all that's over. They put all of their research and development on it, they put everything.

( 02:24:27 ) But what they don't tell you is that these other countries are smart. They say you can't charge more than $88, otherwise you can't sell your product, and the drug companies listen to them. But we're going to do something that we have to do. We're going to tariff our pharmaceuticals, and once we do that, they're going to come rushing back into our country, because we're the big market. The advantage we have over everybody is that we're the big market. So, we're going to be announcing, very shortly, a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. And when they hear that, they will leave China, they will leave other places because they have to sell. Most of their product is sold here, and they're going to be opening up their plants all over the place in our country. We're going to be announcing that. So, that's breaking news. Ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking news. That's what's going to happen.

( 02:25:18 ) What other presidents allow China to get away with is absolutely criminal, but I'm not like the other presidents, and it's not going to happen under President Trump. It's just not going to happen. After all of the abuses they've perpetrated, China's attempting to impose additional unjustified tariffs. Just so you understand, they all got rich because of tariffs. Now, when we do it, "Oh, it's so terrible, what Trump is doing. It's so terrible." They got rich! And not only China, many countries. You look at Vietnam, you look at so many, I could name 50 right now. Biden couldn't do that. He couldn't name any. Name one country. Name any country. What's the name of our country? He doesn't know.

( 02:26:01 ) That's why additional tariffs on Chinese goods are in place effective midnight tonight at 104%. Until they make a deal with us, that's what it's going to be. I think they'll make a deal at some point. China will. They want to make a deal. They really do, they want to make a deal, they just don't know how to get it started, because they're proud people. China will now pay a big number to our Treasury, this is all taxes. And don't let them keep telling you that this is a tax on our people. I hate that. They say it's a tax. No. Often, much of it is paid. And hey, look what happened during my first term. We had no inflation, and yet I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and taxes from China. No other president got 10 cents in tariffs or taxes from China. I got hundreds of billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars.

( 02:26:59 ) And I still got along with them, because they understood what they were doing was wrong. They understood it. When you explain it, I've had numerous leaders tell me, "You're right, sir. I was waiting for you to bring this up." Because some of the trade deals that were made by predecessors as president were so bad, you almost wonder who did these deals. They were either crooked or stupid. They can be nothing else. They were either stupid or crooked. It's terrible. But it's all being changed. I changed a lot of it in the first four years, but it's all being changed. In the first four years, we had the most successful country in history, in terms of economics. We had 88% increase in the stock markets. We had an 88% increase. There's never been any president that had an 88% increase. We had 88%, and there were a lot of happy people. And I think we're going to do much better than that this time, because this time I'm doing what I want to do with respect to the tariffs. I think we're going to do much better.

( 02:28:01 ) And just remember the numbers. When you get up to 2 billion a day, 2 billion a day. They're saying, "Sir, can't be that, can it?" I said, "Yeah, it can." It's the biggest transaction ever made. This is bigger than any deal. You guys, some of you work for companies. Your companies are peanuts, I don't care how big they are, compared. This is the largest transaction in the history of our country. And don't let some of these politicians go around saying, "You know…" Because I'm telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my ass. They are. They are dying to make a deal. "Please, please, sir, make a deal. I'll do anything. I'll do anything, sir."

( 02:28:38 ) And then I'll see some rebel Republican, some guy that wants to grandstand, say, "I think that Congress should take over negotiations." Let me tell you, you don't negotiate like I negotiate. Congress takes over negotiating? Sell America fast, because you're going to go busted. I just saw it today, a couple of your congressmen said, "I think we should get involved in the negotiation of the tariffs." Oh, that's what I need, I need some guy telling me how to negotiate. Ay, ay, ay. I tell you, the happiest people in the world would be China. They wouldn't be paying 104%, I tell you, they'd be paying no percent. We'd be paying them 104%. That's the beauty, is these guys, we got to be… And even the concept of it hurts your negotiation, when they see a little story like that, the other side, it hurts you in negotiation. And then the fake news wants to build it up, and it has no chance anyway. But we have to remain united.

( 02:29:37 ) As I defend workers from unfair trade, House Republicans have a chance this week to bring trillions and trillions of dollars pouring back into America by pushing forward with the largest tax cuts in American history, which is what you're working on right now. The largest in American history. And the reason we had… Because we had a great first term, amazing first term, but I saw that the other day that we had the most successful… I mean, I knew it anyway, but I saw that we had 88% increase. That's a tremendous increase. Think of that.

( 02:30:13 ) And that's with all of the difficulties and all of the fake investigations and the Adam Shifty Schiffs. Can you believe this guy? He's got the smallest neck I've ever seen, and the biggest head. We called him Watermelon Head. I'd say, "How could that big, fat face stand on a neck that looked like this finger? How can it…" It was the weirdest thing. It's a mystery, nobody can understand it. But he's one of the most dishonest human beings I've ever seen. And how we can allow people like that to run in office is a shame, but we did. He was in charge of the witch hunt. He was in charge of the fake witch hunt with Russia, Russia, Russia.

( 02:30:57 ) It was a made-up story, made-up. Think of it. They make up a story, they know it's made-up. It's gone on for a year and a half, two years. Russia, Russia, Russia. I knew nothing about it. The only thing I knew was that I taxed a pipeline that I told you about, that I put all sorts of sanctions and everything else. They never had a problem like they had with me. But it was Russia, Russia, Russia, constant, as a method of… What they did is that was the complaint about why she lost an election, because Crooked Hillary was expected to win the election, but they didn't see what we saw. We saw the biggest crowds in history gathering. Only superseded by the crowds we just had.

( 02:31:41 ) But here's a guy that goes out, and he goes to an intelligence hearing or whatever you might call it, and it's supposed to be secret. He'd walk out, he'd either make a call off the record, "Off the record, this is Crooked Adam Schiff." Shifty Schiff. He's a shifty Adam. Or he'd just go out blatantly and have a news conference. And because it had to do with me and my family, he'd go out and have a news conference and he said… Now, you've got to remember, he knows it's a hoax, because he made it up with Crooked Hillary, so he knows it's a hoax, because we're dealing with human beings on the other side. He'd say, "Donald Trump, Jr., the son of the president of the United States, will spend many years in prison because of what he's done with Russia."

( 02:32:33 ) Now, think of that statement on a human basis. I have a son, a young son, who is being told that he's going for prison on something he doesn't even know what they're talking about. He said, "Dad, I don't know what's going on. They keep talking about I'm involved with Russia. I don't know anything about Russia. I swear to you, Dad." And yet Adam Schiff goes out and makes a statement about a hoax that he made up, that he knows is false. How bad a human being do you have to be? They put my son and my family through that kind of trauma. These are bad people. These are sick degenerates. And I used to be much nicer to them, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. But I've just seen too much. They make up a story about Russia, it was a hoax, and eventually now they've all admitted it was hoax, onto the next one. That's Russia, Russia, Russia.

( 02:33:27 ) But they know it's a hoax, and they say about a young man that he's going to spend the rest of his life in prison, because of what he's done with Russia. He knows it's a hoax. How bad do you have to be to have that happen to your son? And, you know, has a bad effect on a family, a bad effect. "Are you okay, Don?" "I am, Dad, but I don't understand. They keep tying me to Russia. I don't know anything about Russia." He didn't know a damn thing about Russia. It's a disgraceful situation. That's why we got to kick their asses in the midterms, and we got to kick their asses again in four years.

( 02:34:03 ) If we slash taxes on American workers and producers, our economy will soar, jobs will surge, manufacturing will boom, and our country will prosper like never, ever before. We got to get this big, beautiful deal done, we've got to get it done, and get it done now, don't wait two weeks. Don't wait two weeks, see. Bad things happen. Crazy things happen in politics. Just get the damn thing done and stop showboating. A couple of people want to, "Sir, we got to get a little bit more." A little bit more? You know what you're going to get? You end up getting nothing. You end up getting a Democrat bill, or worse. In the past 11 weeks, we've already created 350,000 jobs, it's unprecedented, including 10,000 manufacturing jobs. We haven't even started yet.

( 02:34:53 ) Gas prices. When I came in, they said, "He campaigned on prices coming down; our prices are going up." They're not going up, they're going down. Gas prices are way down. In fact, they had something $2.50 a gallon I saw on television a little while ago. In between watching my great friends on C-SPAN, I saw that the prices are down to $2.50, $2.60, $2.75. When I came in office, it was $3.50, $3.75. But prices are coming down.

( 02:35:29 ) Prices on groceries are coming down. Prices of eggs are down like 87%, 87! They got me with that. I told you, before I even got in office, they tell me about they're down close to 87%. And core inflation has dropped to the lowest levels in four years, and as I said, we had no inflation in four years, despite the fact that I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, so we hadn't even started yet. Nearly $6 trillion of new investment, and that number's now revised up to about seven. Apple, great company, is spending $500 billion because of tariffs. $500 billion. Not $500 million, that's a lot. $500 million. When I first heard the number, I said, "You mean $500 million? You can build a lot of plants for…" "No, sir, $500 billion." "$500 billion?" TSMC, the biggest, most powerful chip maker in the world, this is without that stupid CHIP act, where they say, "Here's billions of dollars to a company that doesn't need it." These chip companies are loaded. They give these companies billions of dollars to build a plant in the United States. They don't build them in the United States. They keep the money. It looks good. They give them billions. No, TSMC, I gave them no money. Great company, most powerful in the world, biggest chip company in the world. They're spending $200 billion in Arizona, building one of the biggest plants in the world, and that's without money. All I did is say, "If you don't build your plant here, you're going to pay a big tax. 25, maybe 50, maybe 75, maybe 100%."

( 02:37:13 ) NVIDIA is investing hundreds of billions of dollars. Johnson & Johnson is investing $55 billion. Eli Lilly is investing $27 billion. DAMAC is investing $20 billion. We have billions and billions be invested by Merck, Clarios, Stellantis, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai, all are putting in billions and billions and billions of dollars. They're buying sites all over, they're building because they don't want to have to pay 25 and 50% tariffs. They're all doing it. And I think they also have confidence in the country. They have a president that have confidence, and I know many of them.

( 02:37:53 ) With the help of people in this room, we are one big, beautiful bill-signing away from the greatest economy in the history of the world. And it's an overhang. This bill's an overhang, because if it doesn't get signed, we will have imposed the biggest tax on the people of this country in our country's history by 40%, biggest tax, because we gave you the biggest tax cut in history. Now we're giving you another, which is one of the reasons that… There are many reasons why we were so successful. That's one of the big ones. The other one is that one-year deduction, all-in one-year deduction. So big, and I know they're working on that, the big deduction. It makes people invest. But now we're working on something that's going to, I think, blow it away. This bill is unbelievable. It's going to bring a lot of money back into our country.

( 02:38:51 ) But if we don't do it, it's going to be a disaster. And you just better hope that people believe that it was the Democrats' fault, because they're very good at saying it was our fault. It'll be the biggest tax increase in history. And all my life as I watched politicians, I wasn't a politician, but I watched them, and I contribute to them a lot, contributed a lot of money over the years, but I watched it, but all my life I hear politicians saying, "We are going to give you a tax cut! I will cut your taxes! We will cut your…"

( 02:39:22 ) They're the only party that says, "We are going to increase your taxes. Vote for me." Who the hell ever heard this? Only these people. We're in a strange time. These lunatics go out and they tell everybody how you're going to have a big tax increase. So, maybe they want the bill to fail so that we can have a tax year… Maybe they'll take credit for it. But I've never heard that said, I've watched politics all my life. I've never seen politicians campaign on, "We're going to increase your taxes", except these crazy Democrats.

( 02:39:52 ) As part of this legislation, I'm committed to spending cuts, and I will fight hard to include the elimination of hundreds of billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse in the bill. We've already found hundreds of billions of dollars through DOGE. And Elon has been terrific, he's been really terrific. But we've found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. But now we need to get the budget resolution, and we have to get it passed in the Senate. We have to bring it through the House. It's going to pass in both.

( 02:40:26 ) One thing I'll say is that Thune has been great. John Thune has been great. And he's worked with your great leader hand in hand. Those two bills are coming up together and they're very similar, and I didn't know if that would happen, because you have a lot of different rules, procedures, complicated stuff. But Mike has been amazing, and John Thune, and they've worked amazingly well, because they've just been going on at the same time. And we're ready to get this thing done and beyond and get rid of the debt hangover ceiling that's a disaster for our country and for everybody, and to give people the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, because we're going to add them both up together. It'll be the biggest tax cuts. It'll blow away the tax cuts that we got them four years ago.

( 02:41:13 ) If we follow through on this agenda, we will be rewarded with a phenomenal economy and a massive victory at the ballot box in 2026, because we will have a record of triumph like no president has ever had, like no Congress has ever had. They will not be able to even touch your seat. Your seat is secure. And we'll pick up 40, 50 or even 60 seats, and we'll have something that's going to be smooth sailing for years to come. If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face.

( 02:41:54 ) In less than three months, our new administration has already accomplished more than most administrations achieve in four years or eight years, and everybody says it. And we have to have this stuff documented and approved. In a matter of weeks, we've achieved the lowest level of illegal border crossings in American history, in history. They have a plaza in front in Tijuana. Tijuana, Mexico. I wouldn't advise going there on a trip, but nevertheless, they have a plaza, big plaza. Held hundreds of thousands of people. Yesterday morning, there were none. There was a man sweeping this massive plate of concrete, massive. And he was sweeping the concrete and there was nobody there. During the same period last year, Joe Biden released more than 184,000 illegal aliens into our country. Think of it, many of these people were from jails and mental institutions. As I said, since my inauguration, we've released a grand total of 9. 9. 9. And they were all, in all cases, medical emergencies. We did that for medical emergency reasons.

( 02:43:08 ) Last month, we officially designated Tren de Aragua, MS-13, and the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. And thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday, and today, we had a big ruling too, we had a very big ruling today. But we will continue to deport these monsters under the Alien Enemies Act. Think of that, Alien Enemies Act. Can you believe it? All things we wouldn't have had to do if the election weren't rigged.

( 02:43:42 ) Now in reconciliation, we need Republicans in Congress to give us the full funding to permanently secure the border and to carry out… That's part of what we're asking for. Who could fight that? We want to permanently secure. Without a border or without fair elections and without a good press, you don't have a country. Well, we had a lousy press. We now have a good border and we're going to get good elections pretty soon. There's a lot of clamor for it. I think it's something that you should work on. You should go out and put a bill in, demanding, you demand, because the states are just an agent of the federal government of you. You got to demand paper ballots, you got to demand one-day elections.

( 02:44:23 ) You know what they do when it's longer than one day? All of a sudden, "Well, we're fixing the room up. Move those boxes. We're putting in an air conditioner." Oh, really? "We'll move the boxes back in a few days." Or, "We're painting the room. Please move the boxes." And you notice the boxes go out and then they move back in about half the number. Oh, it's so sick. One-day election. You don't need any more than that. One-day election, paper ballots. I think you should put a bill in. I mean, I don't know, who's in favor of a bill? Who could not want it? Who could not want it? But I think you should do a bill on that. I think it would be so popular. And more

Donald Trump ( 02:45:00 ):

More importantly than popular, it's so necessary. You have to have great elections. You have to have fair and free elections, and you've got to have borders. Otherwise, you don't have a country. To quickly bring down the cost of energy and lower the price of everything, on day one, I declared a national energy emergency to drill baby drill. We're drilling. Oh, we're drilling. I withdrew from the unbelievably expensive for us, parrot, the Paris Climate Accord. So we were paying, it would've cost us a trillion dollars. A trillion. China doesn't come into it until like 2035. Russia's is based on a 1992 standard when the air was dirty. India was based on a very low standard. Except the United States, we had to pay immediately. We would've spent trillions of dollars on that scam, and it sounds so nice, the Paris Climate Accord. What a beautiful name. Isn't it beautiful? It was a ripoff of the United States.

( 02:46:12 ) Well, don't forget, I mean I'm negotiating with these people, but if you really look the European Union, why was that set up? It was set up to screw the United States of America. They formed a group of countries, got together, and let's make life miserable for the United States of America on trade and other things. And they have done that. They've done that. They've treated us very badly. We don't sell cars into the European Union. We don't sell, they won't take our agriculture. They want their own, but we take their agriculture. We take their cars by the millions. I terminated the green news scam, one of the great scams, one of the great hoaxes in the history of our country. Only superseded by Russia, Russia, Russia, hoax. I canceled Joe Biden's insane electric vehicle mandate where everybody had to have an electric vehicle in a very short period of time.

( 02:47:05 ) Everybody was forced to have an electric vehicle. They built some power stations in the Midwest. They look like gas pumps with electricity, right? They spent $8 billion and four of the nine of them don't work. Four of nine. They built nine or eight, but half of them don't work. They spent $8 billion. Bring in the cables. Bring in the wires. What a great investment that was, billions of dollars they spent. Now, people can go out and buy a gasoline-powered car, a hybrid. They can buy whatever they want. We don't want hydrogen because they have some big problems. They blow up and you never see who is driving the car. You're not recognize them. That's a big problem. They would tell me about, "Sir, I'm really liking hydrogen cars." I said, "But isn't there a problem?" "Yes, they tend to blow up on occasion." I said, "How bad is it?" "Well, we found body parts 250 yards away from the car. We think it was Mr. Jones, but we're going to go to see his dentist and see if we can…"

( 02:48:16 ) So if you have one of those incidents, let's forget it, right? It's a bomb. It's a bomb. I don't want them to work. I actually said, "Don't work on it." Between that and windmills, you can have windmills too. Most expensive form of energy ever. Anybody have a windmill by your house? Congratulations. You'll never sell your house. And today I signed historic executive orders to unleash coal production to the highest levels ever, because coal is the most powerful thing. We have more of it than any… We have more liquid gold under our feet, oil and gas, and we have more coal than any other country. No other country has as much as we have, all different forms of coal. And take a look at China. They're building two coal plants a week. Think of that. Two a week. We are screwing around with wind. Oh, wind. These people are crazy.

( 02:49:23 ) They say, "Oh, it's great for the environment." Yeah, it kills all your birds. You want to see a bird cemetery, walk under a windmill sometime. Got birds all over the place. They're screaming for help, they got whacked. The environmentalist, it's an environmental dream. You know why? Because you're never going to have energy. They're the most expensive form of energy there is, 10 times more expensive than clean natural gas, 10 times, much more expensive than coal, and they're very unreliable. Like if they wanted to watch us tonight on television, " Alice, Alice, I want to watch the president tonight." "I'm sorry darling, but the windmills aren't blowing." We're going to give them confidence to do what they have to do long into the future because coal is going to be a big factor in our country now. It does give us our electricity because there's nothing like coal in terms of power, but it's going to be clean, beautiful coal like our bill. It's going to be clean and beautiful.

( 02:50:29 ) And by the way, they've made tremendous progress with also coal in terms of clean coal. But the coal miners standing alongside of me this afternoon in the White House, they were incredible. They were a beautiful sight to behold. These are really great American patriots, they're beautiful guys. I didn't want to have any arm wrestling contests with any of them. I can tell you that. They're good, strong guys. That's what they want to do. They love to dig coal. That's what they want to do. They don't want to do gidgits and widgets and wadgets. They don't want to build cell phones with their hands. Their big, strong hands are doing a little thing. Remember when Hillary Clinton went to West Virginia? And she had decimated them three weeks before in some state where they make little tiny circuit boards and she said, "We're going to teach the miners in West Virginia how to make a circuit board with little tiny things."

( 02:51:23 ) She said, "We're going to teach them." And then she went to West Virginia. She was in the campaign and she had to go there. Do you remember that stop? It was memorable. It was one of the worst. Did they go after her? And one of the miners said, "I don't want to do anything else but dig coal. I want to dig coal." They said it today. That's what they love. They love doing it. It's like that in a lot of industries. People love doing what they're doing. They want to dig coal. That's what they want. They don't mind going deep in earth. They feel comfortable. Me, I could do without it. But they feel comfortable. They're incredible people, actually. Hard- working, incredible people, and we're giving them their lives back. We've also begun the largest deregulation campaign in history. For every one new regulation, I have directed that 10 old regulations must be eliminated before the first one can go into effect.

( 02:52:17 ) And we're working tirelessly to restore peace through strength and bring back the hostages held captive abroad. We've brought a lot of them back already, but what a sad situation that is. What a sad situation that is. That would've never happened if I were president. October 7th would've never happened. And I said, Russia, Ukraine would've never happened. All this stuff. Inflation would've never happened. Afghanistan disaster would've never happened. Most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. Not leaving, I was going to leave. I'm the one that got them to a point where they could leave, but I was going to keep Bagram, the air base, one of the biggest in the world. I was going to keep it, not for Afghanistan, because it's one hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. Wouldn't it be nice to have it? You know who occupies it now? China occupies it now. Can you believe how stupid this guy was? On top of that, they get blown up at the airport, leaving the wrong airport.

( 02:53:14 ) They didn't leave from Bagram. They left from a local little airport which was crowded and like crazy with the people from the towns and cities and the bomb went off and decimated hundreds of people, killed hundreds. We lost 13 soldiers, but we also had 42 or 48 horribly injured. Arms, legs, face, horribly injured, all because we had a stupid leader. Should have never happened, should have never been involved in that.

( 02:53:44 ) We're also joined tonight by a number of brave souls who recently released from, they were recently released from Hamas captivity. Hamas is just a disaster. The level of hatred. Where are the people? Hamas, they understand what that's all about. Where are you? That's great. How does it feel to be out? How does that feel to be out, huh? You want to come up here for a second? Come on up here. Come on up here. Come on up. Let them up, please. That's great. That's great. I'll tell you these people what they had to go through, I had 10 hostages in my office two weeks ago. What they had to go through is just horrible. Come on up. That's great. That is so nice to see you. That is so nice.

Speaker 35 ( 02:55:29 ):

Thank you. Thank you very much. President Trump, I'm here and I'm alive. President Trump, you saved my life. You saved the life of 33 hostages that because of your efforts and you're setting the hostage crisis at the high priority of what you are doing, among all of the enormous issues and things that you're dealing with since you came into your position as President of the United States, you set the hostage crisis at the highest priority. You got 33 of us home alive. We all owe our lives to you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. And please, please continue your tremendous efforts and your tremendous actions and your tremendous accomplishments. Continue and we'll get, with your help, all of the remaining 59 hostages still in Gaza back home. Thank you.

Speaker 36 ( 02:57:08 ):

Thank you President Trump for bringing my Keith home. Keith's grandchildren are the happiest. Keith's children are the happiest. Keith's family is the happiest, but I and the most happiest. Thank you so much.

Donald Trump ( 02:57:31 ):

Thank you so much.

Speaker 36 ( 02:57:36 ):

We need you to bring all the hostages home. There's 24 that are alive and 59 to come home to their families. Just like I received Keith, they need it too. We have Yair standing here with us, and Eitan, his brother, is underneath the ground now begging to get out. So I'm begging you all to help us. We need your help. Thank you.

Yair ( 02:58:17 ):

So my name is Yair. I've been in hell for 498 days, I've been held in hell with Hamas terrorists. When we didn't see the light, but we feel when we heard President Trump get elected, we knew there is now someone who makes the things happen. We needed, I'm sorry about my English. I am half Argentinian, half Israeli. I'm sorry. We knew we need someone who do the things. That's President Trump. We are here because of President Trump. Thank you. Thank you for your efforts. It's really surreal to be here. I'm a simple man. I am running the bar in the kibbutz in the Nir Oz where I was live, and now I'm here with President Trump who's running the world. We are thankful. We are really thankful, but humbly we ask for more. The last push, the last 59 people, the last 59 hostages among them my brother Eitan, and where [inaudible 03:00:22] Liran brothers, Zibi, Angali, and Evitar, all the brothers, all the families. In a few days we mark the Passover, right? Pesach, it's a family time. So I expect that in the next Seder, when my mother make the knaidelach, the matzoh balls, that my brother Eitan, my little brother, who I call little, but he's 38, but it's my little brother, I hope he can sit with us in the Seder of Passover and wow, it's overwhelming. I just want to tell you again, thank you. Thank you very much.

Donald Trump ( 03:02:01 ):

I just want to say, I said, of the 59 people that you want to bring home, how are they and how are they doing? Do you have any idea? Because they left that whole scene not long ago and they said, "Well, of the 59, 24 are living, the rest are dead." I just heard that. I was told that before by somebody else that 24 are living, the rest are dead. These are young people, largely young people. Young people don't die. Young people are killed. They don't die. But the conditions were so horrible. But think of that, of the 59. And I've had Israeli parents tell me that, "My son is dead, but please bring him home." As though he were alive. She wanted him brought home more than, it just seemed almost more than if her child was living. Amazing.

( 03:03:02 ) They wanted, the mother and father, in three other cases, they wanted to have them brought home. I said, "How is he doing?" "He's dead. It's only his body, but we want him home." So there's an amazing thing. But the 59 that you mentioned, you said that 24 were alive and the rest are dead. This is a terrible thing that's going on with Hamas. Terrible. The hatred is so incredible. It's unbelievable. And the way they were made to live was not even understandable, I think by anybody in this audience. And you have great people in this audience that love you, and they're going to fight for you, and I just want to thank you very much. Thank you.

( 03:03:46 ) Thank you very much. Thank you. We'll get them back. Be careful. It's incredible what they've been forced to live with for 450, 500 days. Incredible. Nobody in this room could really understand it. I found it hard to understand, but we'll not rest until your loved ones have been returned home. And hopefully we can do it the right way. We want to get those 24 out really fast and we're working on it very hard. There was no chance before. This is something that should have been done right at the beginning, during the past administration.

( 03:04:50 ) On day one, we ended the so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies across the entire federal government, the private sector, and it's just not even allowed. I also signed an order making it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. We want to keep it simple. As you know, in a very important executive order. I banned men from competing in women's sports. That was done. And I hope all of these executive orders can be codified, can be voted on by Congress. I can't imagine any Republican that's not going to vote for them. Many, many of them, over a hundred, and I think every single one of them is just common sense good. It's good politics, but the word politics doesn't matter to me so much. It's good for our country.

( 03:05:47 ) If Democrats retake the house next year, they will try to reverse all of the progress that we've made, which is record-setting progress. Instead of house committees run by Mike Johnson, Steve Scalise, Jim Jordan, James Comer, Ronnie Jackson, and so many other of our friends in this audience, the house will be run by the same band of radicals and lunatics you saw at my address to Congress, including Hakeem Jeffries, AOC, Ilhan Omar, Nancy crazy Pelosi and weird Al Green. He is a weird dude. Oh, he should have been treated very badly for the way he behaved that night. Think of it. They didn't stand up. They didn't pay respect to anybody. Think of it.

( 03:06:38 ) You take a look at Laken Riley, you take a look at any of the people there, the parents of these incredible people. The young boy with cancer, serious cancer, want to be in a police department, would give anything to be a policeman someday. They refused to even applaud or acknowledge them. They're sick. There's something wrong with them. They sat, as the stories were explained, two young ladies killed, savagely killed by illegal aliens. They came into our country and they killed these two young ladies. And the Democrats sat there. They didn't smile, they didn't clap, they didn't do anything. I think you frankly win the midterms, just all you have to do is show a picture of these grieving parents, uncontrollably grieving, and they didn't get one clap out of the whole group of them. They just sat there stoic and disgraceful. And you show that in your commercials that you're going to be putting on and you'll win every race that we have in this room.

( 03:07:48 ) That was a bad night for them. And now they know it. They're trying to make up for it, but they're just, I don't know, something wrong with them. That's why every day from now until November 2026, we're going to fight, fight, fight to elect and expand the Republican majority of the house and save our country from these radical left lunatics. We will not be deterred. We will not stop. We will not yield and we will never, ever back down. We're not going to back down. They would lose respect if you back down. They're the ones that backed down. They're the ones that have lost their confidence. They're no good anymore. I saw politicians that were good politicians four years ago. They're not good politicians anymore. They've lost their confidence. They've totally lost their confidence, but they can get their confidence back. So you can't rely on that too much, I guess.

( 03:08:38 ) Together we're liberating our country, reclaiming our wealth, unleashing our energy, protecting our children, rebuilding our military, repelling the invaders, deporting the criminals, destroying the gangs, and unlocking what history will know as the golden age of America. This is going to be the golden age of America.

( 03:08:59 ) With your support, your commitment, and your help to elect more Republicans, we will finish the job that we have really brilliantly started. It's been a brilliant period of years and we go back to 2016. It was brilliant. Then they stole it from us by illegally rigging the election and we did great in that election, but we had to write it off and we all went through hell. I went through hell in particular. Indictments, what we had to go through is hard to believe. Impeachments, two impeachments over nothing, over a phone call that was perfect. They knew it was perfect and they found out after they realized that the calls were essentially taped by the government because you were talking to a foreign leader. When that was played back, they didn't know what the hell to do, but they went forward with it anyway because they're sick people.

( 03:10:02 ) The American dream will come roaring back in our country. Together we're going to make America greater than it's ever been before and I just want to thank you and congratulations on your record evening and I'm with you all the way and I'm going to be campaigning with you and we're going to win, win, win like we've never won before. And thank you to your leadership and Mike, great job. You're doing a fantastic job. Thank you all very much.
