Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Well, thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be with President Erdogan of Turkey. And we've been friends for a long time, actually, even for four years when I was in exile, unfairly, as it turns out, rigged election. He knows about rigged elections better than anybody, but when I was in exile, we were still friends. That's always a good way to find out, test of friendship. But he's a highly respected man. He's respected very much in his country and all throughout Europe and throughout the world where they know him. He's built a tremendous military, powerful military, uses a lot of our equipment. And it's an honor to have him at the White House. We're going to have a lunch together. We're going to have a discussion, big discussion. We do a lot of trade with Turkey and we're going to continue. We're going to do some additional trade. They want to buy F-16s, F-35s and some other things, and we're going to talk to them about that.

( 01:01 ) And we're just going to have, I think, a very interesting couple of hours. We're going to get a lot done, but I have great respect for this man. And we've had a very good relationship for a long time. If you remember, he let Pastor Brunson… He freed Pastor Brunson. Pastor Brunson was put in jail for 35 years before I got there. This was a group that should have stopped it. And the President, after I called him, released him, which was a great thing for our Christian community, our Evangelical community. The Evangelicals really wanted that. It was very important to them, so I always remembered that. But he released him from 35 years in prison, and Pastor Brunson now is healthy, happy, and well. And we're very happy about that. But it's a great honor to have the President of Turkey with us. And how are you?

Tayyip Erdogan ( 01:57 ):

Fine.

Donald Trump ( 01:57 ):

Say a few words.

Tayyip Erdogan ( 01:58 ):

Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 01:59 ):

Great Guy.

Tayyip Erdogan ( 01:59 ):

[foreign language 00:02:05].

Translator ( 03:10 ):

First, Mr. President, I am very pleased that this visit actually coincides with the 80th UNGA, so I am very pleased to be here with my colleagues and friends. And as we have said during the first term of your Presidency and during your second term, we are able to carry Turkey and US relations to a much different level and process. And as you've said, we have an opportunity here today to be able to discuss some of the issues regarding the F-35, the F-16, and also the Hogba case. And we will have an opportunity to thoroughly discuss them. And based on what you have mentioned regarding the [inaudible 00:03:45] school, we are ready to do whatever we can that falls on our part. And I will, when I get back, try to discuss this issue with the esteemed Mr. Barthalomos to discuss how we can move forward on that.

Donald Trump ( 03:56 ):

Okay, very good. I would like to be able to do that. The Greek Orthodox Church was here and they would really like to have some help. They need some help, and I said I'd mention it. We appreciate it. So, this is a tough man. This is a guy who's highly opinionated. Usually I don't like opinionated people, but I always like this one. But he's a tough one and he does an amazing job in his country. And we've had tremendous relationships, both having to do with war and having to do with trade. And I guess today we're talking about both. I'd like to have him stop buying any oil from Russia while Russia continues this rampage against Ukraine. And they've been fighting. They've lost millions of lives already. And for what? For what? Disgraceful. And I said yesterday, let it keep going because their economy is absolutely terrible right now.

( 05:00 ) And I think it's a shame that they're doing that, killing a lot of people unnecessarily. 7,818 people were killed last week, mostly military people, their people and Ukrainians. More Russians actually than Ukraine, a little bit more. But it's such a waste of human life, and so we ought to stop. Putin ought to stop. And with that, we'll get to a little bit of a discussion. We're going to make some great trade deals for both countries. We do a lot of business with Turkey. They build great products. They build beautiful, great products. Really fantastic manufacturers, and we buy a lot from them and they buy a lot from us. Would you have any questions, please?

Speaker 4 ( 05:42 ):

Mr. President, you repeatedly called out Obama and Biden administrations for their stupid decisions. One example you gave was a refusal to sell the Patriot Missile Defense System to Turkey, which resulted in the expulsion of the country from their [inaudible 00:05:59] program. Now, you are known to be a great deal-maker in Turkey. What can you do to undo this stupidity?

Donald Trump ( 06:04 ):

You're from?

Speaker 4 ( 06:04 ):

Yes, CNN, sir.

Donald Trump ( 06:10 ):

CNN? Well, because you sounded like a nice guy. CNN is fake news, but you sound like the real deal to me, so I'll answer the question. We're going to be discussing the Patriot System, which is the best system. We'll discuss that. We're going to discuss the F-35. We'll be discussing all of the things that you know about and that some of that you mentioned. And I think he'll be successful with buying the things he'd like to buy.

Speaker 4 ( 06:34 ):

What concrete steps can you take to-

Donald Trump ( 06:36 ):

Well, we'll have to see. We haven't even started yet.

Speaker 4 ( 06:38 ):

[inaudible 00:06:40].

Donald Trump ( 06:39 ):

But I know he wants the F-35, and he's wanted that, and we're talking about that very seriously. And the F-16, we're in great shape. Certain other things he needed, as you know, and I'm going to see to it that we get that to him. He needs certain things and we need certain things. And we're going to come to a conclusion. You'll know by the end of the day. Go ahead, please.

Speaker 5 ( 07:03 ):

[foreign language 00:07:09].

Tayyip Erdogan ( 07:03 ):

[foreign language 00:07:26].

Donald Trump ( 07:31 ):

Hold it. Because I haven't learned this language yet. What did he say?

Translator ( 07:44 ):

The gentleman was asking, "Mr. President, you have referred to President Trump's peace efforts and you have also contact with many leaders in the region. And what do you think that you can do about this?" And Mr. President has said that, "Yes, I believe in the peace efforts that President Trump is leading, and together we will be able to overcome the challenges in the region."

Donald Trump ( 08:05 ):

I think it's true. He's got tremendous influence in the region. Yeah, please.

Speaker 6 ( 08:10 ):

Mr. President, when are you planning to lift CAATSA sanctions against Turkey?

Donald Trump ( 08:13 ):

Sanctions against Turkey?

Speaker 6 ( 08:14 ):

[inaudible 00:08:16].

Donald Trump ( 08:15 ):

Could be very soon. If we have a good meeting, almost immediately.

Speaker 7 ( 08:24 ):

[inaudible 00:08:25] Erdogan is removing tariffs on US goods and what impact it would be in US production?

Donald Trump ( 08:31 ):

Where are you from?

Speaker 7 ( 08:32 ):

Turkey.

Donald Trump ( 08:33 ):

I see. We have a lot of people from Turkey here. That's good because I like your questions very much actually. They're very nice questions. And we'll see you about tariffs. We're going to be talking about tariffs.

Speaker 7 ( 08:42 ):

You already removed them?

Donald Trump ( 08:44 ):

Well, we're going to be talking about that.

Speaker 8 ( 08:45 ):

Are you planning to lift sanctions on Russia, even if not all NATO countries stop purchasing Russian oil?

Donald Trump ( 08:55 ):

We're going to be seeing about that. The NATO countries were disappointing in that regard, but they've been very amazing in other ways. They did… As you know, they went from 2% to 5% GDP. And that's a big step. And it's paid. They have the money there. And we're selling a tremendous amount of military equipment to NATO. We're selling. We're not giving, like Biden did. We're selling it to NATO. And it's a lot. They're buying a lot. And I assume they're giving it to Ukraine. They could buy it for other reasons too, but I assume they're giving most of it to Ukraine. But they're buying highly sophisticated weaponry, and they're paying for it full price. And that's how we're involved. Biden gave $350 billion. Look, this war would've never started If I were President. If I were President, this war would never be happened. It would've never happened. Yeah.

Speaker 9 ( 09:48 ):

Mr. President, I'd like to ask about Gaza. Are you on the same page Mr. Erdogan for policy in Israel?

Donald Trump ( 09:55 ):

Well, I don't know his stance. I can't tell you about that. I just say that we want to get Gaza over with. I had a great meeting with the leaders of that area, of that region, generally speaking, the Middle East. We had a great meeting the other day at UNGA, as you know. And I think we're close to getting some kind of a deal done. We want to get the hostages back. I have to get the hostages back. We're the ones that got the hostages, all of them, that we have now. But it looks like there are 20 living hostages and probably 38 or so dead hostages. Pretty sad. And the parents of those dead souls, those dead mostly men, boys, in many cases, like literally boys, they want those bodies back so badly, as much as though they were alive. And so we had a very good meeting with the representatives of the most powerful countries in the Middle East, and I think we're going to be close to a deal.

Speaker 10 ( 10:55 ):

Mr. President, we've noticed that in the Ukrainian War and during the Israeli-Iran War, the airspace of the NATO countries is very fragile and it needs to be stronger. And in that sense, Turkey being the second largest army in NATO, it needs to support its air force and air defense. How do you look at this issue in general as a NATO [inaudible 00:11:33].

Donald Trump ( 11:33 ):

Well, we support them. Yeah, we're in NATO, and they're paying now 5% of GDP. Nobody thought that was possible, and they agreed to that six months ago when I was there. And the relationship is very good. The NATO countries, with us is the strongest it's ever been. We used to complain that they're paying 2%, but they're not paying. The United States was paying almost everything. And now they're paying 5%, and they paid. And that's trillions of dollars. We're talking about trillions of dollars, and they're spending that, giving that money to us. And we are giving them great defensive… the Patriots and all of the different Javelins, all the different missile systems and everything else that they want. But it's trillions of dollars, so we appreciate that they did that. So, they went from 2% to 5% of GDP, and that was something that nobody even would bring up. Biden should have brought it up a long time ago because under Biden we paid $350 billion, and all it did is make things worse. So, we'll see how it goes.

Speaker 11 ( 12:42 ):

[inaudible 00:12:39] F-35s to Turkey? Fighter jets, F-35s-

Donald Trump ( 12:44 ):

We're talking about the fighter jets for Turkey. Yes, we are.

Speaker 12 ( 12:47 ):

Are we going to see any steps going to be taken today about the issue… about the things are going on in the Gaza, Palestine? Are we going to see some-

Donald Trump ( 13:00 ):

It could be today. Yeah, could be today. We have a very strong dialogue going on with Saudi Arabia, with… I would say you have four or five real leaders that are being good. As you know, I met with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE. We met with Jordan. The King of Jordan was there. We had great… We had a really great meeting. I think a lot was determined at that meeting. And I have to meet with Israel, and I have to do that also. They know what I want. And I think we can get that one done. I hope we can get it done. A lot of people are dying, but we want the hostages back. We don't want them back, one this week, one in two months from now, three later, like the way it's been going. We got them all back. We got a lot of them back. We got our American. The American, Alexander. We got the American hostages back. But we have now 20 plus 38 bodies, dead bodies. And we want them all back and we want them back at one time.

Speaker 13 ( 14:05 ):

Do you think President Erdogan will help to release the hostages in-

Donald Trump ( 14:15 ):

Do I think what?

Speaker 13 ( 14:16 ):

Do you think President Erdogan will help to release the hostages?

Donald Trump ( 14:19 ):

I don't know if he'll help in that. I don't really think we have… I don't think it'll be necessary in this case. I think we're going to be in a pretty good position. There are a lot of people that want that done. I met with great leaders. Look, you saw the people that were there, and great leaders. Egypt was also represented. We met with the leaders of that part of the world, and they want to see if they can get something done. And I'm going to have to tell Israel, "Let's go. We want to get the hostages back." Everybody wants to see that war over with, by the way, everybody. So, we're going to see what happens.

Speaker 14 ( 14:54 ):

Mr. President, how do you see a joint initiative with President Erdogan to bring the President of Russia, Putin and President Zelenskyy to the negotiating table?

Donald Trump ( 15:11 ):

Well, I can tell you that President Erdogan is very respected by both of them. Everybody respects Erdogan. They really respect Erdogan. I do. And I think he could have a big influence, if he wants to. Right now he's very neutral. He likes being neutral. So do I like being neutral. But he's somebody that if he got involved, the best thing he could do is not buy oil and gas from Russia. If he did that, that would be probably the best thing. He knows Putin like I know Putin. I thought Putin…

( 15:44 ) I settled as seven wars, and it's probably more than that, if you really want to know the real facts, but seven wars, and I thought this would be among the easier ones to settle, but I'm very disappointed in Putin. And he's been fighting hard, he's been fighting long, and they lost millions. They lost like 1,000,000 soldiers. And with all of the heavy bombardment over the last two weeks, they've gained almost no land. Think of that. They've gained almost no land. And I'm not going to ever call anybody a paper tiger, but Russia has spent millions and millions of dollars in bombs, missiles, ammunition, and lives, their lives, and they've gained virtually no land. I think it's time to stop. I really do.

Speaker 15 ( 16:36 ):

A few months ago you met with Aliyev and Pashinyan. Can you follow up on-

Donald Trump ( 16:51 ):

Where?

Speaker 15 ( 16:51 ):

You met with Aliyev and Pashinyan, Azerbaijan President Aliyev, and Pashinyan. Can you follow up on what you want to say about current process?

Donald Trump ( 17:00 ):

No, I can't. I like this guy. I like him. He's from CNN. Fake news. The worst fake news, but I like him. So, it's CNN Turkey. I'll get going. Go, go, go.

Speaker 4 ( 17:16 ):

Syria has been a major issue between the two countries for the past decades.

Donald Trump ( 17:24 ):

That's right.

Speaker 4 ( 17:26 ):

And you said, "The future of Syria is in Erdogan's hands," back in I think December and January. And the countries are in the process of integrating [inaudible 00:17:36] fractures into the main government. When do you want to see that happen?

Donald Trump ( 17:40 ):

Well, I think President Erdogan is the one responsible for Syria, for the successful fight in ridding Syria of its past leader. And I think this man is responsible. He doesn't take the responsibility, but it's actually a great achievement. They've been trying to do it for 2000 years. I said, "He does it. He did it." They're your surrogates. I think you should take the credit for it. I told him, "Take the credit. For 2000 years you've been trying to take over Syria." He took over Syria, and he doesn't want to take the credit. All of those people are his surrogates. But the leader of Syria, the new leader, as you know, I took sanctions off in order to let them breathe because those sanctions were very strong.

( 18:24 ) But I think we should have a major announcement today. He was responsible for that victory. It was a victory for Turkey because they've been fighting, as you know, for like 1,000 years, and it never went… It was back and forth, but he's responsible for that. So, he would have a lot to say with respect to Syria, but at his request, I took… and the request also of the King of Saudi Arabia, it's very interesting, and Qatar, they said, "If you could take the sanctions…" We had very strong sanctions. They couldn't have lived with those sanctions, and I took them off to give them a chance to breathe. But the President was one of the people that was responsible for that. He asked me to do it, and I did it.

Speaker 16 ( 19:14 ):

Mr. President, furloughs are very typical when the Government shuts down. Why is the administration directing federal layoffs of federal workers this time around?

Donald Trump ( 19:23 ):

Well, this is all caused by the Democrats. They asked us to do something that's totally unreasonable. They never change. They want to give money away to illegals illegally. People that entered our country illegally, they want to give them massive federal money. And we don't want to do that because it means everyone's going to just keep pouring back. Right now, we have absolutely perfect borders, like you haven't seen in many years. Even better than the… I had great borders during my four years, but these borders are stone-cold closed. You can only come into our country legally now, but the Democrats want to give it all away. Also, they want to open up the borders. Take a look at that. It's a big thing. They want to open borders again after what we're going through now, getting rid of prisoners, getting rid of all of these people dropped out from mental institutions, drug dealers, drug addicts, everything that…

( 20:15 ) They're putting everybody into our country. It's all ended now. But this is what Schumer wants. This is what the Democrats want. They want to have… And they want to take our money. We're doing well. Because of tariffs, we're doing unbelievable. We're making more money than we ever have made. And by the way, we're going to take some of that tariff money that we made… Just to get off the subject for a second, we're going to take some of that tariff money that we made, we're going to give it to our farmers, who are for a little while going to be hurt until it kicks in, the tariffs kick into their benefit. So, we're going to make sure that our farmers are in great shape because we're taking in a lot of money.

( 20:51 ) We're finding… The other day, it was very interesting, they found $31 billion. They said, "Sir, we found 31." I said, "You mean positively, right?" They said, "Yeah, 31 million more than we knew." And they said, "We don't know where it came from." I said, "Check the tariff shelf." They came back the following morning, they said, "You're right, sir. It came from the tariffs." We've never seen anything like this. So, what we're going to be doing is we're going to be taking some money from all of the tariff money that we've taken, and we're going to distribute it to our farmers until the tariffs kick into their benefit, which ultimately the farmers are going to be making a fortune. But it's a process of… It has to kick in. All right, maybe one more.

Speaker 12 ( 21:36 ):

Mr. President, there was another shooting at an ICE facility in Texas yesterday.

Donald Trump ( 21:43 ):

Yes, terrible.

Speaker 12 ( 21:43 ):

Detainees were killed. The FBI Director posted on social media bullets that were engraved with a message, "Anti-ICE." He just posted another thing on social media saying they recovered a handwritten note from the subject that read, "Hopefully this will give ICE agents real terror to think, 'Is there a sniper with AP rounds on that roof?'" Who do you hold responsible for the uptick in left-wing violence in the country we're seeing?

Donald Trump ( 22:06 ):

Radical left rhetoric. The radical left is causing the problem. They're out of control. They're saying things. And they're really dumb people. I look at Crockett, I look at some of these people, they're very low IQ people actually. But the radical left is causing this problem, not the right, the radical left. And it's going to get worse, and ultimately it's going to go back on them. Bad things happen when they play these games. And I'll give you a little clue: the right is a lot tougher than the left, but the right's not doing this. They're not doing it. And they better not get them energized because it won't be good for the left. And I don't want to see that happen either. I'm the President of all the people, but the radical left is causing this. Radical left Democrats are causing this problem, and it gets worse. It gets worse. And it'll be a point where other people won't take it anymore, and that will not be good for the radical left. And we don't want that. Okay. Thank you. Brian. Brian.

Speaker 17 ( 23:11 ):

Mr. President, it seems like an indictment of James Comey is imminent. Would this be the first step in accountability for pushing the hoax of Russia, Russia, Russia, along with Barack Obama involved as well?

Donald Trump ( 23:24 ):

Well, I can't tell you what's going to happen because I don't know. You have very professional people headed up by the Attorney General and Todd, Todd Blanche, and Lindsey Halligan, who's very smart, good lawyer, very good lawyer. They're going to make a determination. I'm not making that deter… I think I'd be allowed to get involved if I want, but I don't really choose to do so. I can only say that Comey is a bad person. He's a sick person. I think he's a sick guy actually. He did terrible things at the FBI, but I don't know. I have no idea what's going to happen. Thank you very much, everyone.

Speaker 18 ( 24:04 ):

Thank you. Thank you, guys. Let's go. Get out. Thank you. [inaudible 00:24:05]. Let's go. Get out. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go. [inaudible 00:24:05]. Guys, let's go. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you. Pick it up. Thanks, guys. Let's go. Let's go. Get out. Thank you. Thank you. Keep going, keep going. Let's go. Thanks, guys. Come on, cone on, come on. Thank you. Right this way. Thank you.
