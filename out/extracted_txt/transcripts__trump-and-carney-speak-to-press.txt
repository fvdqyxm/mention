Speaker 1 ( 00:03 ):

All right. Just relax. We're walking in. Just relax. [inaudible 00:00:11].

Speaker 2 ( 00:04 ):

One second, sir. Just one second. Can you get everybody in? [inaudible 00:00:25]

Speaker 1 ( 00:04 ):

Okay, you're in. Peter?

Speaker 2 ( 00:29 ):

Are we good to go, sir?

Mark Carney ( 00:29 ):

Are we good to go?

Speaker 2 ( 00:31 ):

Go ahead, sir.

Mark Carney ( 00:32 ):

All right. Thank you. Mr. President, welcome to Canada.

Donald Trump ( 00:35 ):

Thank you very much.

Mark Carney ( 00:36 ):

It's a great honor. Happy birthday.

Donald Trump ( 00:38 ):

Thank you.

Mark Carney ( 00:39 ):

A few days short.

Donald Trump ( 00:40 ):

A little bit.

Mark Carney ( 00:40 ):

A few days short, but didn't have a chance to see you on the day. Happy birthday to the U.S. Military as well, 250th. And this is the 50th birthday, if you will, of the G7. This marks the 50th birthday of the G7. And the G7 is nothing without U.S. leadership and your personal leadership, the leadership of the United States, many issues, geopolitics, economic, technology, and working hand in hand with the United States, Canada and the United States, and the other G7 partners with your leadership. I'm very much looking forward to the meeting them. Grateful to have you.

Donald Trump ( 01:17 ):

Well, thank you very much, Mark. I appreciate it. And we have developed a very good relationship, and we're going to be talking about trade and many other things. And we have a whole group of people, some traders and some other people. I see my top economy people. But we have a very talented group of people, and you do too. And I know they work together very well. I look forward to that. The G7 used to be the G8. Barack Obama and a person named Trudeau didn't want to have Russia in. And I would say that that was a mistake, because I think you wouldn't have a war right now if you had Russia in. And you wouldn't have a war right now if Trump were president four years ago.

( 01:56 ) But it didn't work out that way. But it used to be the G8, and now it's, I guess, what's that, nine years ago, eight years ago, it switched over. They threw Russia out, which I claimed was a very big mistake, even though I wasn't in politics. And I was very loud about it. It was a mistake, in that you spend so much time talking about Russia, and he's no longer at the table. So it makes life more complicated. But you wouldn't have had the war. And other than that, I think we're going to accomplish a lot, and I expect to. And I think our primary focus will be trade and trade with Canada. And I'm sure we can work something out.

Mark Carney ( 02:34 ):

Yes, very good.

Donald Trump ( 02:36 ):

Thank you very much.

Mark Carney ( 02:37 ):

Yes, so much. Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:02:39].

Speaker 5 ( 02:46 ):

What is holding up a deal with Canada, from your perspective?

Donald Trump ( 02:49 ):

It's not so much holding up. I think we have different concepts. I have a tariff concept. Mark has a different concept, which is something that some people like. But we're going to see if we can get to the bottom of it today. I'm a tariff person. I have always been a tariff… It's simple. It's easy. It's precise. And it just goes very quickly. And I think Mark has a more complex idea, but also very good. So we're going to look at both, and we're going to see what… We're going to come out with something hopefully. [inaudible 00:03:23]

Speaker 6 ( 03:24 ):

Do you think a deal is achievable within days, within weeks? Is there that kind of runway?

Donald Trump ( 03:29 ):

Yeah, it's achievable. Both parties have to agree. Yeah, sure. [inaudible 00:03:34]

Speaker 7 ( 03:35 ):

Have you heard any signals or seen any messages from intermediaries that Iran wishes to de-escalate the conflict?

Donald Trump ( 03:42 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 7 ( 03:44 ):

What have you heard? What have you heard from the Iranians?

Donald Trump ( 03:46 ):

They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before. I had 60 days, and they had 60 days. And on the 61st day, I said, we don't have a deal. They have to make a deal. And it's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war. And they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late.

Speaker 7 ( 04:09 ):

And what would you say, in your opinion, what would it take for the U.S. to get involved in this conflict militarily?

Donald Trump ( 04:15 ):

I don't want to talk about that. We'll see.

Speaker 7 ( 04:17 ):

And you mentioned Putin. Do you think that he should have a seat at the G7 today, that it should be the G8?

Donald Trump ( 04:22 ):

I'm not saying he should at this point, because too much water's gone over the dam maybe. But it was a big mistake. Obama didn't want him. And the head of your country, the proud head of your country, didn't want him. This was a big mistake. You wouldn't have that war. You have your enemy at the table. I don't even consider him… He wasn't really an enemy at that time. There was no concept. If I were president, this war would have never happened. But likewise, if he were a member of what was called the G8 at that time, it was always the G8, you wouldn't have a war right now. [inaudible 00:04:57]

Speaker 8 ( 04:57 ):

What material support and what intelligence support are you providing Israel?

Donald Trump ( 05:03 ):

We've always supported Israel. We have, for a long period of time, strongly. And Israel is doing very well right now.

Speaker 9 ( 05:10 ):

Why not have China as the G8? Why not have China here, the biggest economy in the world after the United States?

Donald Trump ( 05:16 ):

Well, it's not a bad idea. I don't mind that. If somebody wants to suggest China coming in, I think we suggest. But you want to have people that you can talk to. They don't talk. Putin speaks to me. He doesn't speak to anybody else. He doesn't want to talk, because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8, as I would be, as you would be, as anybody would be. He was very insulted. And, I mean, he was thrown out by Trudeau, who convinced one or two people, along with Obama. He was thrown out. And he's not a happy person about it. I can tell you that. He didn't [inaudible 00:05:50] He basically doesn't even speak to the people that threw him out. And I agree with him. [inaudible 00:05:56] Go ahead.

Speaker 10 ( 06:00 ):

On immigration, why are you ordering ICE to target Democratic inner cities? What's behind that?

Donald Trump ( 06:04 ):

I don't know what you're saying.

Speaker 10 ( 06:05 ):

You did a post last night where you said you want ICE to really target Democratic-

Donald Trump ( 06:09 ):

Yeah, I want them to focus on the cities because the cities are where you really have what's called sanctuary cities. And that's where the people are. I look at New York. I look at Chicago. I mean, you've got a really bad governor in Chicago and a bad mayor. But the governor is probably the worst in the country, Pritzker. But I look at how that city has been overrun by criminals, and New York and L.A. Look at L.A. Those people weren't from L.A. They weren't from California, most of those people, many of those people. And, yeah, that's a focus. Biden allowed 21 million people to come into our country. Of that, vast numbers of those people were murderers, killers, people from gangs, people from jails. They empty their jails out into the U.S. Most of those people are in the cities, all blue cities, all Democrat-run cities. And they think they're going to use them to vote. It's not going to happen. [inaudible 00:07:06].

Mark Carney ( 07:11 ):

If you don't mind, just I'm going to exercise my role, if you will, as G7 chair, since we have a few more minutes with the president and his team. And then we actually have to start the meeting to address some of these big issues. [inaudible 00:07:25].
