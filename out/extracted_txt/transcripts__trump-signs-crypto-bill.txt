Crowd ( 00:00 ):

Mr. President, [inaudible 00:00:10] on Wall Street [inaudible 00:00:12].

Donald Trump ( 01:13 ):

Thank you, everyone. Yeah, we worked hard. It's a very important act. The Genius Act, they named it after me. This is a hell of an act. I did something very unusual. They said, "This has been something that a lot of people thought it was impossible, some of the things that have been done." And, of course, I added the word great, the Great Big Beautiful Bill, that was something that nobody thought possible. They thought it would be in anywhere from seven to maybe three… I'll go the opposite direction, but three to seven different bills. And we said, "Let's just put it in one because this way there's something for everyone."

( 01:41 ) And there really is, there's a lot of things for everyone. And when we get the word out, how great that is for every single person in this country, virtually, and all they have is a soundbite. Death. You know what their soundbite is? Death. Aren't they nice? Death? They are the most incompetent people. They've lost their confidence. They've lost everything if you think about it.

( 02:04 ) But Jasmine Crockett is on her way. She's on her way. She's the new star of the Democrat Party. Jasmine Crockett. They're in big trouble.

( 02:15 ) But I have to tell you, that was great and this was great. And I am so tired of making phone calls at 2:00, 3:00, 4:00 every morning. Getting calls from our great speaker, "Sarah. We have 12 hard nos." I say, "Mike. Mike, it's 2:00 in the morning. We have 12 hard nos." The good news is I call up, "Hello Jim. How are you? "Sir, you have my vote." Boom. "Sir, you have my vote." They just want a little love. Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people. It's [inaudible 00:02:49].

( 02:49 ) I actually said to John Thune and I said to Mike, "Listen, I want to have a party, but not to those people that I have to speak to endlessly, every time." And they're wonderful. They always seem to come through, other than a couple. Rand Paul Jr. from the Congress and Rand Paul from… No. Other than a few people.

( 03:19 ) But I said, "I want to have them over. We're going to have a party for everybody in Congress. Everyone in Congress except Walt. And I'll tell you what, Tom is definitely coming. The whole group. Where are those 12 people? They're the only people I don't see. [inaudible 00:03:39].

( 03:37 ) And I would say of the 53 senators, we have 48 in here. You won't even have to come to that one. But these are the greatest people because they always vote yes and we don't have to go crazy. You trust us. We trust you. That has been a very special group of people. We really do. I mean, 96% phenomenal and 4% extremely difficult. But they get there. Most of them, not all of them. Those are the ones we really don't like.

( 04:13 ) But I want to thank you all for being here. This is really a big day. This afternoon, we take a giant step to cement American dominance of global finance and crypto technology as we sign the landmark Genius Act into law. So, congratulations to everybody. It is a big deal. We've come a long way since the Biden administration when they had no idea what you were all talking about and half of you were under arrest for no reason whatsoever. For no reason.

( 04:47 ) And we want to have it, not China. China wasn't actually happy. They were watching this. They like it. And we've got this, we've got AI, we've got a lot of great ones happening. And this is a very big thing. And I want to thank the bill's author, Senator Bill Hagerty, a very good friend of mine. Thank you, Bill. He's a great guy. He's a very handsome guy, looks great. He's got the whole package.

( 05:19 ) But I got to know he was their best and it was in Japan. We had a little problem with Japan on trade, but he was my ambassador to Japan. And I went to Japan and he is speaking fluently Japanese. I said, "Did you learn it as a child?" "No, no. I just learned it over the last four or five months." I said, "You learned Japanese, maybe the single hardest language to learn. It's actually breathing rather than… It's breathing." I'm not going to imitate it because we'll end up with a big story and I don't want that. But he spoke totally fluent Japanese. I said, "That's very impressive."

( 05:57 ) And he was introducing me to Mr. Honda. I said, "Oh, are you in the car business?" He goes, "Yes." I said, "You're a very rich man." Then he said, "Mr. Toyota, right? Toyota." And I said, "What business are you in, let me ask?" He said, "Cars." He was my interpreter and I was so impressed.

( 06:19 ) And I was getting ready to leave, he said, "Sir, I'd like to run for the United States Senate." I said, "Where are you from?" He said, "Tennessee." I said, "Well, I love Tennessee, but do they know you there?" " No, but if you endorse me, I'll win." Right? And I endorsed him and he took a 48 point leap. And they didn't know who the hell he was and he's turning out to be a great senator. And now, they all know who you are.

Bill Hagerty ( 06:44 ):

Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 06:45 ):

So, you are. You're fantastic. And we thank you. And just the fact that you're doing this and you understand this, it is a complicated world and you understand it, Bill, so you've been great. Thank you very much.

( 06:55 ) We're also pleased to be joined by our great vice president, JD Vance. JD [inaudible 00:07:01]. Late at night on the phone, I said, "JD, how about you taking three or four of these people, please, because three or four I cannot speak to. I just can't." And he'd take them and he'd come through. Hey, JD?

JD Vance ( 07:18 ):

Yes, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 07:20 ):

Also, speaker Mike Johnson. He is [inaudible 00:07:24]. He's been unbelievable. I mean, if you go by what we're doing, if you keep at this pace… You can't keep it up for another 200 days. But I will tell you this, if you keep up this pace for another week, you go down as the greatest speaker in the House in history. So, one more week. One more week.

( 07:47 ) Who needs Tip O'Neill? Who needs Tip O'Neill? He's better looking than Tip O'Neill, too. But no, he's been going at a fervent pace. Wouldn't you say that's right? Your wife probably says, "You are crazy. You've been aging beautifully in front." Actually, he's an amazing speaker, a great leader and everybody likes him and respects him. That's why, with a very small majority, like three… We had a time when we were one. Remember? We said, "We're one heart attack away from losing the House." Then, we won a couple of seats and a couple of other… Now, we have seven, maybe? Maybe if we're lucky, seven. But I don't think anyone's ever done this before to win with those small… We had a little help from Tom, too. Right? And a lot of other people.

( 08:38 ) I want to introduce, also, Secretary Howard Lutnick, who's been fantastic. You have done a great job. We've got trade deals coming out of our ears. Right? We got so many trade deals. They're all calling. So many and I really mean this, too. It's like how do you deal with so many? But I always say, "When we sent out the paper, that was the deal." The fake news doesn't want to hear that. When I send out the paper that you're paying 35 or 40% tariff, that's a deal. Then they'll call and see if they can make a little bit different kind of a deal, like opening up their country to trade. In some cases, they've never been opened. But we're doing well, we have a couple of big ones to announce pretty soon. Right?

Howard Lutnick ( 09:21 ):

Right.

Donald Trump ( 09:21 ):

You could almost do it today. Maybe, we'll see. Maybe, later on, we'll do it.

Howard Lutnick ( 09:25 ):

That's fine.

Donald Trump ( 09:26 ):

Senator Bernie Moreno. A great victory, Bernie had. Great victory. A great victory. That was really, really tough races. A lot of people weren't sure anybody could win that seat. And you won it in easy fashion. Right?

Bernie Moreno ( 09:42 ):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump ( 09:43 ):

We won it together, when you think of it. But you won it in an easy fashion. You did a great job. Great guy.

( 09:49 ) House Majority Whip. This is a great leader. Tom Emmer, a great politician and leader. Really good. And I

Donald Trump ( 10:00 ):

I like his wife even better. His wife is, she's the boss, but you are married to a fantastic woman, huh? And he knows that, and he likes hearing it because some people don't. They say, "Sir, could you please stop saying that my wife is better than me, sir." Those are the guys that don't usually end up with a good marriage. He's got a great marriage. So thank you, Tom. You really are a fantastic leader and representative. And representatives Troy Downing, French Hill, where's French Hill? Where is he? [inaudible 00:10:39] when he was walking down the hall, I'm saying, "French," he said, "I'm there, sir." You a great, great, great guy. Everyone respects you. French, you know that Bill Huizenga. Bill, thank you very much. Thank you.

( 10:55 ) Dan Heuser, I thought he was going to become the next governor of Pennsylvania, but he likes Congress better, I guess. But I think you're terrific, and I would've always been behind you. That I can tell you. Tim Moore, John Rose, John? Hi John, [inaudible 00:11:17]. Brian Steil, [inaudible 00:11:22] that's good. GT Thompson, GT. Thank you, GT. Anna Paul, good friend of all of ours, thank you Anna. Monica De La Cruz. Monica, she's here someplace. Thank you Monica. Thank you Monica.

( 11:39 ) Mike Haridopolos. Mike, thank you, Mike. Mike Lawler, Mr. SALT. Well, it should guarantee your district. I mean, you worked hard for New York, right? And you're on television, I'm on television, so this should be good for a couple of points. But without you and your couple of friends from New York, that wouldn't have happened. That was not easy, right? Congratulations. Great job. Anna Paulina Luna. Anna was so great. Even if she's here or not here, I want to tell you, she has been so great and worked so hard to make sure we got it approved.

( 12:25 ) Ralph Norman. Ralph. Ralph? What happened to Ralph? Nick Begich. Nick, [inaudible 00:12:33] good job. Good votes. I just saw a great poll in you, huh? Very good. Congratulations, Nick. Andy Ogles. Andy? Who's a terrific friend. Beth Van Duyne. Beth, thank you very much for your great support. Roger Williams, a great baseball player, who also had to take a bullet, unfortunately, but he is a great guy. He was involved in that whole catastrophe, but he's fantastic and has been from day one,, along with a lot of other people that I won't call out, because I have no idea where the hell you are. I think I saw Jason here. So where's Jason? Oh, it's lucky I called your name. [inaudible 00:13:20] because I invited you at the last moment, right? He was over there doing some business in the White House. But you've been incredible in your position. Nobody knows more about taxes and finance than you do, so we appreciate it, right? Is that true, Howard?

Speaker 1 ( 13:32 ):

Oh yeah.

Donald Trump ( 13:33 ):

It's true. Thanks, Jason. Great job. And you'll help out with that other matter. You make him so strong and powerful, right along? With Deputy Secretary of Treasury, Michael Faulkender. Where's Michael? And Ambassador Ken Howery. Ambassador, thank you.

( 13:59 ) I also want to recognize some of the countless industry leaders here today, including Brian Armstrong of Coinbase. Dave Ripley of Kraken, Jeremy Allaire of Circle. Good job, Jeremy. Paolo Arduino of Tether. Ryan McInerney of Visa. That's a good company. Chris Pavlovski of Rumble. Chris. [inaudible 00:14:50] you're always the front row guy. You're just being nice today I think, huh? How's Rumble doing, good?

Speaker 2 ( 14:54 ):

Doing great.

Donald Trump ( 14:56 ):

Great. If Rumble's doing good, that means truth is doing good. That's good. You're doing a great job. Thank you Chris very much. Vlad Tenev of Robinhood. [inaudible 00:15:13]. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, these are two [inaudible 00:15:17] the whole pack, they have a lot of things, actually, but Gemini's just the one for today, right? They've got the look, they've got the genius, got plenty of cash, and it's great that you're on our side. You guys are great. I can never tell them apart, but their mother, I ask, "Can your mother tell you apart?" And the answer is yes, right? Easily, or is it tough for her?

Speaker 3 ( 15:45 ):

Easy.

Donald Trump ( 15:45 ):

Easy. You guys have been great, thank you very much. It's great to be with you. Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out. You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation. And even before this signing, over the last year, year and a half, I think your stuff has gone up more than any stock or just about more. A couple of stocks that were pretty good, I will say. But you have certainly as an industry gone up more than anybody. Nobody's gained the respect in such a short period of time, but this signing is a massive validation of your hard work, and your pioneering spirit, and your ability to never give up. Because a lot of people would've given up two, three years ago. So I want to thank you for contributing to the incredible strength of America.

( 16:37 ) This is going to make it stronger, and congratulations on this incredible achievement. You've made our dollar look really good, and strong, and powerful. It's good for the dollar and it's good for the country. And that's why I backed you at an early stage.

( 16:50 ) And I also did it for the votes, because you did come out and vote. And they changed tune, Biden's team, they changed tune right in the middle of the campaign, all of a sudden they loved you guys. They dropped all charges, they did have … I got you guys out of so much trouble. And you know what? I don't think anybody voted for them, right? Because you remember they treated you very unfairly, actually. So it's a great honor that we were involved. And it was, it was a tremendous amount of support that we got at the polls, we won … Think of it.

( 17:23 ) We won every swing state. We won by millions of votes. We won the popular vote, we won the districts by 2750, think of that, to 505. Different districts, too, by the way. Every once in a while that number can change, but it doesn't change by much. The map was almost totally red, and you guys were with us right from the beginning. Exactly one year ago this month, many of you were with me in Nashville, Tennessee. Do you remember that day, right?

Speaker 4 ( 17:53 ):

Yeah.

Donald Trump ( 17:53 ):

That was a big day in Nashville, Tennessee, when we became, and I became, the first presidential candidate ever to address the Bitcoin conference. And at this time, and at that time, crypto builders and founders were under relentless assault by the Biden administration, which was trying to crush your industry, and crush you as people, and go after your families. They were a vicious group of people.

( 18:19 ) People don't realize that they were vicious. Incompetent, but vicious. Well, Joe was an incompetent guy, but he was always known as a vicious guy. I guess if you're going to be in that, you're probably off … If they're incompetent, it's better, right? You don't want to have a vicious guy that's competent. If you did, I wouldn't be standing here today.

( 18:40 ) But I pledged that we would bring back American liberty and leadership, and make the United States the crypto capital of the world. And that's what we've done. And under the Trump administration, this is only going further. You're going to do really well. I mean, I'm so proud of what you've done in the last couple of years. And very important, on day one, I remember I did this, and I said this, and I mentioned this name, and I got the greatest applause of the all campaign. We fired Joe Biden's SEC Chair, Gary Gensler. We fired him.

( 19:10 ) But no, I was making a speech, and it was just a line in a speech. And I said, "And I will fire Gary Gensler." The place exploded. I finished that one and I said, "What the hell did that guy do?" There was a lot of hatred there, but that turned out, I got familiar with everything, it turned out you were absolutely right. In his place I appointed a visionary chairman who wants America to build the future and not block the future. He's going to be unbelievable. He'll

Donald Trump ( 20:00 ):

… go down as one of the greats and Paul Atkins. Where are you, Paul? And they offered Paul, the crypto guys, they said… Everybody said not only crypto, every of us, they all wanted Paul for the position. And he's a tough cookie too. And they actually said, "We don't care. We just think he's fair." All they wanted was fairness and they have somebody that you're really a champion of the street and you're a champion of the country. You're going to do a fantastic job. I saw you interviewed the other night. I watched it about two o'clock in the morning. There was a little thing called C-SPAN, which I don't know how many people were watching. Don't worry you were on prime time too, but they have to have a little bit of you. I didn't want to embarrass you, but fantastic job really. You are absolutely so perfect for the job. Congratulations, Paul.

( 20:56 ) And Paul is here today among the commissioners, various commissioners including Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda. Hester and Mark Uyeda. Thank you, Hester. Thank you very much and thank you, Mark, wherever you may be. Is Mark here? Oh, stand up Mark, I didn't… Yeah, good job. Good. I'm glad I gave you a second pep, you didn't hear because of the thunderous applause from Hester, but thank you. I heard tremendous things about both of you. Thank you very much.

( 21:34 ) My first week in office, I also established the first-ever presidential working group on digital assets and we have an executive director, where's Bo Hines? Bo Hines? And Bo was a great football player, right? Bo was a great football player, one of the better players in college football. So I know you from that also. See, who would think that I know that? I know a lot of things, Bo. But he was a champion player. Stopped the weaponization of government against crypto and Bitcoin and we ended the lawless operation choke 2.0, that was a bad operation. And I kept my promises to the community and granted a full presidential pardon to Ross Ulbricht, Ross Ulbricht, and you have no idea how important that name became, it was like a symbol and his mother was unbelievable. His mother was an unbelievable woman, but it was so important to a certain group of people.

( 22:38 ) And in the truly momentous act last March, I signed an executive order establishing the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as the United States Digital Asset Stockpile and that's all signed up. And with today's signing, we're pushing even further into the exciting new frontier. Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins. This could be perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the internet itself. A lot of people are saying that, I don't know, what do you guys think? Yes? If you say yes [inaudible 00:23:23] I think it's great that you're involved, I will tell you.

( 23:28 ) Many Americans are unaware that behind the scenes, the technical backbone of the financial system is decades out of date, many, many years out of date and you know that Paul and others are stripping it out, but payments and money transfers are costly and take days or even weeks to clear. Under this bill, the entire ancient system will be eligible for a 21st Century upgrade using the state-of-the-art crypto technology. Who would've thought we would've been saying that two years after I really met you for the first time?

( 24:03 ) The GENIUS Act provides banks, businesses, and financial institutions and framework for issuing crypto assets backed one-for-one with real US dollars, treasury bills and other cash equivalents. It's really strengthening the dollar and giving the dollar a great prominence. And you have this little group called BRICS, it's fading out fast, but BRICS, they wanted to try and take over the dollar, the dominance of the dollar and the standard of the dollar and I said, "Anybody that's in the BRICS consortium of nations, we're going to tariff you 10%." And they had a meeting the following day and almost nobody showed up. They say, "Leave me alone." But they didn't want to be tariffed and they [inaudible 00:24:47] it's amazing.

( 24:47 ) We're not going to let the dollar slide. If we have a smart president, you're never going to let the dollar slide. If you have a dummy, that could happen. Like the last one, if you ever asked him about the dollar slide, he would've no idea. But we can't let that ever happen again. Consumers, vendors and people all over the world would then be able to use those stablecoins for ultra-low-cost transactions that are cleared and settled in a matter of seconds rather than weeks and months. And that's really an amazing thing with the privacy, flexibility and decentralization of cash, this revolution has the potential to supercharge American economic growth and empower billions of people to save and transfer in US dollars.

( 25:32 ) It's really all backed by the dollars. It's really a great thing and we had a lot of Democrat support. I have to tell you that I was shocked anytime we get one… But we had a tremendous amount of Democrat support, which we appreciate and which just shows you that you're doing the right thing. This will increase demand for US treasuries, lower interest rates and secure the dollar's status as the world's reserve currency for generations to come. The reserve currency is so important. If lost that, that would be losing a world war. We can never let anyone play games with us and that's why when I heard about this group from BRICS, six countries basically, I hit them very, very hard. And if they ever really form in a meaningful way, it will end very quickly, I will tell you, for them. They won't be gone very long. I don't think they'll even do it. They're virtually afraid to meet.

( 26:33 ) I also remain fully committed to my pledge never to allow the creation of a central bank digital currency in America. It won't happen, okay? And I [inaudible 00:26:53] with some the congressmen and women, they wanted that so badly, that was so important to them. I was impressed that they knew what the hell it was, to be honest with you. "Please sir, please. Central Bank digital currency, well, you have to make, sir." And I'm saying, "What do you know about that?" It's amazing the knowledge that people have gained all of a sudden. We had a lot of problems with some of them. I said, "We've already got it from the Fed, from commerce and from an executive order. You don't need it a fourth time."

( 27:22 ) "Sir, we have to get it." It's amazing. But they knew their subject, didn't they, and we helped them out. My first week in office, I signed an executive order to ban the creation of a CBDC in the United States and very soon I look forward to signing legislation that will codify and make it a permanent law, put it in permanence. I'm also committed to signing landmark crypto market structure legislation this year to grow the industry. We're going to be growing it even more than people ever thought. It's a really hot industry. And for a little while, two nights ago, we were a little concerned because we were a little short on votes. I would say maybe we were about nine short, nine short at 3:00 in the morning. We were about four short at 3:30 in the morning and we were in good shape at four o'clock in the morning, right? But the people and few people have fought harder for the bill that we're signing than some of the people here today. You have been unbelievable. It's our White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who has done exceedingly well. He has a show now and showman, but a couple of years ago, it's probably two years ago now in San Francisco, and I did his show and I heard he's a very smart guy and we had a great show. You've kept it going a lot longer and you got [inaudible 00:29:03] rated every show, he knows what to say. He knows what…

( 29:05 ) It rained and we had millions and millions of people. He said, "What's going on?" But we had had a great show and I said, "That guy's really smart." I said, "If I get elected…" I was running at that time. "If I get elected, we're going to bring him into government in some way. He's worth a fortune. He's made a lot of money. He's a very rich billionaire." But this is more important, isn't it? This is me too. It's like, does it matter? I know Howard and I talk about it all the time. Howard could go back to his wonderful brokerage firm, hire one or two people, and it's not the same as what you're doing, right? We're doing the biggest deals in the world. Actually, the deal we're doing now in tariffs is, when you add it up, the biggest deal ever made in history. It could be a thousand IBMs. I mean, if you think of it, it's the biggest deal ever

Donald Trump ( 30:00 ):

Done. So it's hard to go back to a brokerage firm and make $79,000 commission on [inaudible 00:30:10], but I want to ask David, so David's been fantastic. He's done an incredible job and I'd like to ask David to come up and say a few words. Thank you very much.

David ( 30:19 ):

Thank you President Trump. It's a great honor to be here, and it's true that I never expected to work in government at all. And then everything changed after President Trump came on my podcast and I accepted this job as crypto's [inaudible 00:30:40] I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to work for a president who really wants to get things done for the American people. And if anything, that's been an understatement. The first six months, this Administration had been more successful than any administration in American history. It's just been incredible. President Trump has worked at tech speed, we're used to working fast in Silicon Valley, but even this is fast for us in Silicon Valley. The speed at which you move, President Trump, it's really incredible.

( 31:11 ) And now today you have another historic legislative achievement that is a monumental step to fulfill your promise to making the United States the crypto capital of the world. This genius act will unlock American dominance in the crypto industry by creating clear rules of the road. It will update archaic payment rails with a revolutionary new payment system, and it will extend US dollar dominance, like you said, globally by creating a digital dollar that people all over the world can use. And for every digital dollar in a crypto wallet, there'll be a traditional dollar in a US bank account, which will create trillions of dollars of demand for US treasury. So that is the power of this bill, is US dollar dominance. This is a huge promise made and promise kept by President Trump.

( 31:52 ) And there's just a few other people I'd like to thank first my family for being here. Thank you. And Bo Hines, who, president Trump mentions, the director of our crypto council. He really did the heavy lifting here. So Bo, I just want to thank you. And my chief of staff, Tracy Johnson as well, who also does the heavy lifting. Bill Hagerty and French Hill and all the congressmen and senators that have already been mentioned by President Trump, so I'll save you the time, but it's really been an honor to work with all of you. This was really a team effort. But most of all, I want to thank President Trump for accomplishing what nobody thought was possible. And it's true that just earlier this week, the media was reporting that this bill was dead, this bill was dead. And then the media didn't know one thing, that we had a secret weapon. We have a deal-maker in chief. And thanks to President Trump, he stepped in and saved this bill. And it's because of your vision, your leadership, your determination, and your skill that we're all here today. So thank you very much, President Trump.

Donald Trump ( 33:05 ):

Is that Laura? Please come, say something here. This is our superstar. She was the head of the Republican Party and nobody complained about [inaudible 00:33:12] married to a young gentleman named Eric. They have beautiful two children, but she has been so good. She stepped into that position like it was nothing. Then we won and she said, "Dad, I'd like to go home right now to my beautiful husband and my son and daughter." Right? But you did a fantastic job and you worked with a great gentleman too. He's doing a fantastic job. But I just want to thank you, I just saw you standing back there, I wanted to bring her on in. Thank you very much. Thank you.

( 33:50 ) So under the Trump Administration, I just got back from Saudi Arabia and we went to Qatar, we went to a number of countries. And I will tell you the level of respect that this country has now is incredible. The UAE, I tell you what, we had a time there, but every leader said the same thing. They said, "One year ago, your country was dead." And they say it that way, it was like, I didn't know whether I was supposed to be happy or insulted. But the truth is, we were in deep trouble. But they said, "One year ago, your country was dead. And today you have the hottest country anywhere in the world." And it's true. We have the hottest country in the world. We had a country, we were a laughing stock with the borders, people pouring in. Can you imagine last month, in the month of June, actually zero, now I don't even believe that zero because you have hundreds of thousands pouring in and then all of a sudden it's zero, but they have it down to zero. And very liberal people take that particular toll. It's a liberal group, so they're not giving us any favors. They had zero people coming through our border. Can you imagine that? From literally hundreds of thousands of people flowing in from all over the world.

( 35:11 ) They came from prisons, jails, they came from mental institutions, gang members, they were gangs. They came from all over the place, from every country, they came from the Congo and Africa, a lot from the Congo. They came from South America, a lot of came from Venezuela. They emptied their jails into our country. Can you imagine? They allowed that, emptied their jails into our country and they let them walk right into our country like perfect. 11,888, committed murder, 50% committed more than one person. They murdered more than one person. 50% of 11,888, and we had murderers and we're getting them out. And Tom Holman and Christie are doing a great job. And Tom Holman, I'll tell you, is he central-casting or what? And he takes abuse, but they just keep fighting and they're winning and we're winning in the courts and we're winning everywhere.

( 36:07 ) But we've got the hottest country in the world and you're a big part of it. So the golden age of America is upon us, and with today's signing, the future of crypto and the crypto industry, the US dollar working together because they really are hand-in-hand is going to be stronger and bigger and better than ever before. And I just want to thank everybody, some tremendous people in this room, and maybe when I sign, I'll ask some of our great senators and congressmen to come on up. Some of the top crypto guys, please come on up because you guys work very hard on this and we'll sign this and we'll get onto the next battle and we'll win. But we're winning all over the world right now. It's not even close, not even close, and we're going to keep it going. Thank you everybody very much.

Speaker 5 ( 36:52 ):

Can you all sit down please? Thank you all so much. Sir, can you sit down? Thank you so much.

Donald Trump ( 37:25 ):

This is not an auto pen, by the way, which is a big scandal. If that were a Republican, it would really be a big scandal, but it is one of the great scandals of our time. Thank you very much everybody.

Speaker 6 ( 37:39 ):
