Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

… and everybody, and I think it's going to be great. And then I'll be back here fighting for the bill and I hear it's going okay. We'll move it along. But we'll be back here pretty early.

Speaker 2 ( 00:12 ):

Mr. President, on the bill, [inaudible 00:00:15] warning some Republicans not to go too crazy with the cuts. Are there parts of the bill or amendments that you think cut too much?

Donald Trump ( 00:21 ):

We're going to have to see the final version. I don't want to go too crazy with cuts. I don't like cuts. There are certain things that have been cut, which is good. I think we're doing well. We're going to have to see. It's very complicated stuff. Great enthusiasm, as you know. And I think in the end we're going to have it.

( 00:39 ) What do you think, Caroline?

Speaker 3 ( 00:40 ):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump ( 00:46 ):

Yeah, I think you're right.

Speaker 4 ( 00:46 ):

What do you think about Zohran Mamdani having such a hard time condemning the phrase globalize intifada?

Donald Trump ( 00:48 ):

I think he's terrible. He's a communist. The last thing we need is a communist. I said there will never be socialism in the United States. So we have a communist. I think he's bad news and I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with him watching him because he has to come right to this building to get his money. And don't worry, he's not going to run away with anything.

( 01:10 ) Frankly, I've heard he's a total nut job. I think the people in New York are crazy. If they go this route, I think they're crazy. We will have a communist for the first time, really, a pure, true communist. He wants to operate the grocery stores, the department stores. What about the people that are there? I think it's crazy.

Speaker 5 ( 01:34 ):

Mr. President, what happened to Elon Musk?

Donald Trump ( 01:34 ):

Who?

Speaker 5 ( 01:36 ):

What happened to Elon Musk?

Donald Trump ( 01:37 ):

Nothing. No, he's upset that he's losing his EV mandate and he's very upset about things, but he could lose a lot more than that, I can tell you right now. Elon can lose a lot more than that.

Speaker 6 ( 01:52 ):

[inaudible 00:02:00].

Donald Trump ( 02:00 ):

We hope it's going to happen and we're looking forward to it happening sometime next week.

Speaker 6 ( 02:04 ):

[inaudible 00:02:05].

Donald Trump ( 02:04 ):

We want to get our hostages back. We want to get the hostages back.

Speaker 7 ( 02:21 ):

What if The Big Beautiful Bill doesn't pass? Do you have to go through item by item by item and pass this stuff one at a time, or are you just going to try again?

Donald Trump ( 02:24 ):

I think we're going to get there. It's tough. We're trying to bring it down, break it down so it's really good for the country. Trying to get a lot for everybody. And it's a big bill. And smaller bills would've been easy, but they wouldn't have been as good. I think it's going to do okay.

Speaker 7 ( 02:39 ):

And with the Alligator Alcatraz, is the idea that if some illegal immigrant escapes, they just get eaten by an alligator or a snake or something?

Donald Trump ( 02:48 ):

I guess that's the concept. This is not a nice business. I guess that's the concept. Snakes are fast, but alligators, we're going to teach them how to run away from an alligator, okay? If they escape prison, how to run away. Don't run in a straight line. Run like this. And you know what? Your chances go up about 1%. Not a good thing.

Speaker 8 ( 03:16 ):

What are you going to talk to Netanyahu about next Monday?

Donald Trump ( 03:19 ):

So he's coming here. We're going to talk about a lot of things. We're going to talk about the great success we had. We had an incredible… In Iran, we had an incredible success, like really nobody's had in many, many years. That was a precision war strike. And the word obliteration can now be used because the Atomic Energy Commission said you can't even get into the place. It was demolished. It was really demolished. It was a great, brilliant strike. And how to go forward. We're also going to talk about Gaza. We want to get the rest… We've got a lot of hostages back, but we're going to talk about Gaza.

Speaker 9 ( 03:52 ):

[inaudible 00:03:57] Elon Musk?

Donald Trump ( 04:00 ):

I don't know. We'll have to take a look. We might have to put DOGE on Elon. You know what DOGE is? DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn't that be terrible? He gets a lot of subsidies, Peter. But Elon's very upset that the EV mandate is going to be terminated. And you know what? When you look at it, who wants… Not everybody wants an electric car. I don't want an electric car. I want to have maybe gasoline, maybe electric, maybe a hybrid, maybe someday a hydrogen. If you have a hydrogen car, it has one problem, it blows up. So I'm going to give that one to Peter. Going to let Peter test it off. The hydrogen cars and when they blow up, it's serious. They find you five blocks away, it's that good.

Speaker 10 ( 04:47 ):

Mr. President, [inaudible 00:04:49]? Are there any countries we could expect to see before the July 9th deadline?

Donald Trump ( 04:53 ):

Everything's going well. Honestly, everything. This is very complicated because it's very big, a lot of different areas. Look, the Republicans have their heart in it. The Democrats, they just want to destroy our country. A Democrat wants to destroy the country. They won't vote on it. They don't vote on anything. There's the biggest tax cut in history. Everything. Everything is the biggest in history. It's the best bill we've ever had. We can't get one Democrat vote.

Speaker 11 ( 05:27 ):

When do you think you'll get final… When do you think you'll get final-

Donald Trump ( 05:30 ):

He's a nice guy, Peter? What do you think?

Speaker 12 ( 05:30 ):

Very nice guy.

Speaker 11 ( 05:30 ):

When do you think will get final passage of the bill?

Donald Trump ( 05:32 ):

Hopefully soon. Hopefully today, if we can, final passage. When I say final, let's take Senate at a time, okay? But I think Senate should be today and we go to the House.

Speaker 11 ( 05:46 ):

And what about Senator Murkowski? Is there any way to placate her?

Donald Trump ( 05:48 ):

Who knows? You tell me. You tell me. Is there? Alaska has done so well with me. There's never been a president better to Alaska than me. But it doesn't mean people appreciate it. Have a good day.
