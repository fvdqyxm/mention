President Trump ( 38:38 ):

A smart, hard-working guy. So it's good to say hello to you. Congratulations. We've had a tremendous relationship, I have personally with Bahrain over the years and it has been a fantastic ally. And anything they needed we helped them and anything we needed they helped us. And we're going to be talking about a lot of different things, including the most perfect military maneuver that anybody's seen probably in 50 years, which took place a few weeks ago in Iran, knocked out their entire potential nuclear capacity and it was obliterated. I used that term. They said, well maybe that's too much. I said, no. It turned out it was more than obliterated. They can't go back. And we're just really going to talk about some things including trade. We're going to be discussing trade, we do a lot of trading with Bahrain. And we're going to have lunch after this, but we'll take some questions. First, I'd like to ask the Crown Prince to say a couple of words. And he also has a father who's living and well and doing fantastically as I understand it.

Crown Prince ( 39:51 ):

He is.

President Trump ( 39:52 ):

And somebody who's respected all over the Middle East and all over the world. And thank you very much for being here.

Crown Prince ( 39:57 ):

Thank you Mr. President. Thank you one and all. It is indeed a great honor to be here on this fine morning to put into action the relationship that exists between our two countries. We will be discussing security issues, we'll be discussing trade and investment, which is very important. We're very happy to be announcing $17 billion worth of deals that are coming to the United States. And this is real. This isn't-

President Trump ( 40:26 ):

It's real money.

Crown Prince ( 40:27 ):

These aren't fake deals. These are real deals.

President Trump ( 40:28 ):

They don't have to borrow the money.

Crown Prince ( 40:29 ):

We don't have to borrow it, it's coming in. And it only builds upon a legacy that we're very proud of. We have had a relationship in the civil side between our two countries since 1893 and formally since 1948. So may it long continue and we look forward to many, many more years of productive partnership. Thank you, Mr. President. You honor us.

President Trump ( 40:53 ):

We will have that indeed, many good years. And I'd say right now is your top year and we appreciate the investment. It's a great… We left as you know, Saudi Arabia. We were just there, Saudi Arabia and Qatar was so great. Qatar was great. We had the UAE and we had a couple of other visits, but all great places and we left with $5.1 trillion of investment and they all want to be investing in the United States. I think we have over $16 trillion of investment coming in, which is a record, and we're only a little bit into the year. And let's say the first two months, I sort of took it easy because we had to fix up the Oval Office. I had to devote my time to fixing it up. But now we had to fix up our country. I think everyone is saying we have the hottest country now anywhere in the world. We were dead a year ago. We are a dead country and now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world.

Crown Prince ( 41:55 ):

Thank you. Mr. President.

Speaker 3 ( 42:00 ):

[inaudible 00:42:01] developments in Syria at the moment.

President Trump ( 42:02 ):

Well, I can't comment. I think I'll ask Marco to say a few words on Syria.

Marco Rubio ( 42:06 ):

Yeah, it's complicated. Obviously these are historic long-time rivalries between different groups in the southwest of Syria, Bedouins, the Druze community, and it led to an unfortunate situation and a misunderstanding it looks like, between the Israeli side and the Syrian side. So we've been engaged with them all morning long and all night long with both sides. And we think we're on our way towards a real de-escalation and then hopefully get back on track in helping Syria build the country and arriving at a situation there in the Middle East that's far more stable. So in the next few hours we hope to see some real progress to end what you've been seeing over the last couple hours.

Speaker 4 ( 42:46 ):

Mr. President, Jerome Powell, do you have plans or have you're back considering firing Jerome Powell and what's your justification you're thinking about this to do this?

President Trump ( 42:56 ):

Well, he's too late. He's always been too late, hence his nickname too late. He should have cut interest rates a long time ago. Europe has cut them 10 times in the short period of time and we cut him none. The only time he cut them was just before the election to try and help Kamala or Biden, whoever the hell it was, because nobody really knew. Obviously that didn't work, but he tried to cut them for the Democrats, Kamala. How did that work out? You'll tell me it didn't work out too well, did it? I think he does a terrible job. He's costing us a lot of money and we fight through it.

( 43:36 ) The country's become so successful that it doesn't have a big impact, but it does hurt people wanting to get a mortgage. People want to buy a house. He's a terrible Fed chair. I was surprised he was appointed. I was surprised, frankly, that Biden put him in and extended him, but they did. So no, we're not planning on doing anything. We're very concerned. He's doing a little renovation for 2.5 billion of the Fed, building a renovation, and they have a close-to $900 million cost overrun. And it's a shame. But the biggest cost overrun is the cost overrun for interest rates because we should be paying three points lower and we would save a trillion dollars a year in interest if that were the case. And all it is the stroke of a pen.

( 44:29 ) And that goes for his board too, because his board is not doing the job because they should try and rein this guy in. So he is doing a lousy job. But no, I'm not talking about that. Fortunately we get to make a change in the next, what, eight months or so. And we'll pick somebody that's good and we'll pick somebody, I just want a fair job. We want to see lower interest rates. Our country deserves it. We're making a lot of money. We're doing great as a country. We have no inflation. Record stock market. Record business. Record everything. Everything's a record now. We had the worst inflation in history under Biden and now we have almost no inflation. We've done a great job and we should have the interest rates cut.

Speaker 4 ( 45:13 ):

So you're saying the other day that Scott Bessent, you're so happy with him at Treasury, that he's not your top option to replace Jerome Powell, whenever that may be, whenever you decide what you want to do with him?

President Trump ( 45:24 ):

Scott's doing a very good job now. I'm very happy with Scott. [inaudible 00:45:27]-

Speaker 4 ( 45:27 ):

Is Kevin Hassett on the top of your list?

President Trump ( 45:29 ):

Kevin's somebody we'd consider, yeah. Kevin is fantastic too. We have a lot of good people for that job. It's not a tough job, to be honest. Assuming you're smart, it's not a tough job. If you're dummy, then I guess it's a tough job. But it might be one of the easiest jobs I've ever seen. And now on top of it, he's building a close to $3 billion little nest egg for himself. He's not doing the right job. We should be saving a trillion dollars a year on interest when he talks about cost. We should be saving, think of it, a trillion dollars a year. Add that with the tariffs and everything else. But he just doesn't want… He's a knucklehead. But we'll see how… He's listening to this and going, that's a strange conversation. But we like to say it like it is.

( 46:20 ) But we have a lot of people that want that job very badly. And I'm only interested in low-interest people, frankly. Because you don't need… So they had the 71 different economists and people that, the experts that they picked about a month ago, I was the only one along with one person from maybe the Wharton School of Finance, the two of us got it right. 69 people, including Powell got it wrong. And he wants to hire thousands of new people to help him decide where we're going in the future. It only takes one good mind. It doesn't take 5,000 good minds. So they're expanding the Fed. It's the dumbest thing I've heard of, but you know, it's very autonomous.

Speaker 5 ( 47:06 ):

Just a follow up on that, sir. Is [inaudible 00:47:11] are you completely ruling out the idea of firing Jerome Powell?

President Trump ( 47:15 ):

I don't rule out anything, but I think it's highly unlikely unless he has to leave fraud. I mean, it's possible. There's fraud involved with the 2.5, $2.7 billion renovation. It's a renovation, how do you spend $2.7 billion and he didn't have proper clearance, et cetera, et cetera. So you know that's going on. So there could be something to that. But I think he's not doing a good job. He's got a very easy job to do. You know what he has to do? Lower interest rates.

Speaker 6 ( 47:48 ):

[inaudible 00:47:49] have you drafted a letter, Mr. President, [inaudible 00:47:52] decide that you are going to fire him. Have you drafted a letter?

President Trump ( 47:53 ):

No, I haven't drafted a letter.

Speaker 6 ( 47:54 ):

So you didn't show a letter to Republican lawmakers last night?

President Trump ( 47:58 ):

No. I talked about the concept of firing him. I said, what do you think? Almost every one of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are. We talked about it. In fact, we had 11 of the 12 people here yesterday for a very big bill having to do with crypto, et cetera, and other things. And all of the votes are going with us, every single vote. But during the conversation when we were talking about it, I asked, what would you do about that? They all said would fire him.

Speaker 7 ( 48:36 ):

Thank you for taking the question, sir. You were in Pennsylvania yesterday. You unveiled $92 billion worth of investments. One of those jumped out though $15 billion in Homer City to build the largest national gas power plant ever. I was at the rally where you told Homer City residents that you would not forget them when the biggest coal plant in Pennsylvania closed down. You delivered for them yesterday. What message do you have for those residents?

President Trump ( 48:58 ):

Well, I'm happy. Homer City, I was there and I said, I'm going to produce something. I don't know what, because they had shut down this massive coal plant, one of the biggest in the country, and it was just purchased by the gentleman that you met yesterday. A very substantial man. I don't know if he's as… Maybe not as substantial as you, I'm not sure. But he's pretty substantial. You know who I'm talking about. And they're going to spend billions of dollars on rebuilding it and it's going to be the largest plant of its kind in the world, I believe actually in the world. And it's going to be great. So we really fulfilled that promise to Homer City, but it's to Pennsylvania, basically. I won Pennsylvania and very conclusively won Pennsylvania, so I owe them a big debt of gratitude. But thank you for bringing that up.

( 49:50 ) We raised it's actually going over 100, so it'll be over $100 billion to be invested in Pennsylvania. It was Pennsylvania energy project. Everybody was there, Larry Fink was there. I mean everybody was there. And done a great job. The Senator did a great job. We were very proud. That was a great meeting yesterday. Thank you very much.

Speaker 8 ( 50:17 ):

[inaudible 00:50:17] for each of you. So for the Crown Prince, are you planning on taking any of the Patriot missiles that you're going to receive from the United States and divert those to help Ukraine?

Crown Prince ( 50:32 ):

We have no current plans as we have an operational requirement inside Bahrain to keep them there for the present time.

President Trump ( 50:37 ):

He's got plenty of them too.

Speaker 8 ( 50:39 ):

And Mr. President, the Fentanyl bill-

Crown Prince ( 50:42 ):

They're wonderful. They're wonderful pieces of kit.

President Trump ( 50:44 ):

They work very well.

Crown Prince ( 50:45 ):

American technology is the best.

President Trump ( 50:46 ):

Yep.

Speaker 8 ( 50:47 ):

On the Fentanyl bill that you're signing-

President Trump ( 50:49 ):

That's maybe the most important part of this. This choice of everything. And we make the best military equipment by far in the world.

Crown Prince ( 50:57 ):

Bar none.

President Trump ( 50:58 ):

There's nothing close, right?

Crown Prince ( 50:59 ):

Bar none.

President Trump ( 00:00 ):

President Trump ( 51:00 ):

Yeah, thank you.

Speaker 9 ( 51:01 ):

Now on the fentanyl bill that you're signing today, do you hope that that's going to restart law enforcement cooperation with China on getting the fentanyl?

President Trump ( 51:08 ):

Yeah, I think China has been helping out. It's been a terrible situation for many years with fentanyl, but since I came here, we're talking to them and they're making big steps. They're also, as you know, being penalized. You know that, right? They're being penalized with tariffs because of the fentanyl, but they want to do something. We'll see what happens.

Speaker 10 ( 51:33 ):

Mr. President, Mr. President.

Speaker 11 ( 51:33 ):

Mr. President. I know you're-

Speaker 12 ( 51:37 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. An American from Tampa was beaten to death. He was killed by Israeli settlers in the West Bank. His family has been calling on you to help prosecute his killers. Are you going to do that? An American from Tampa?

President Trump ( 51:52 ):

Yeah. Your first sentence is really … Go ahead.

Speaker 12 ( 51:55 ):

An American citizen from Tampa, Florida, has been killed in the West Bank. His family has been asking you to prosecute him. Are you going to help find this guy?

Marco Rubio ( 52:06 ):

Yeah. Well, so first of all, if you've seen yesterday, Ambassador Huckabee has asked the Israelis to conduct an investigation. We want to get all the information about who was involved. We protect all American citizens anywhere in the world, especially if they're unjustly murdered or killed. So we're gathering more information, but I hope you saw yesterday, Ambassador Huckabee in Israel asked the Israelis authorities to produce an investigation and concrete information about who was responsible for his murder.

President Trump ( 52:30 ):

They're reporting that tomorrow. We have a meeting on it. They're going to be reporting that to me.

Speaker 12 ( 52:34 ):

Can [inaudible 00:52:34]?

President Trump ( 52:34 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 12 ( 52:36 ):

Do you think that the Gulf area now is more secure and do you believe that a negotiation with Iran is necessary at this stage?

Crown Prince ( 52:44 ):

Well, I definitely believe that the volatility of the situation has been reduced and we didn't know where it was going to go on the Sunday. We were very glad when we found out on the Monday. Let me put it that way. And should the Iranians want to negotiate, I believe the ball is in the court. That is the true reality of where we stand today. They are the ones that stand to benefit from a negotiation.

President Trump ( 53:09 ):

And they do. They want negotiate. They want to negotiate badly. We're in no rush because we said we could have made a deal. They should have made a deal, and then we bombed the hell out of there, various places. We're in no rush. But if they want to negotiate, we're here. Yeah?

Speaker 6 ( 53:31 ):

Mr. President, Mr. President. I know you want to move past all this intrigue over the Epstein files, but I do want to ask you to clarify something you said this morning. You said this was all a hoax. Has your attorney general-

President Trump ( 53:40 ):

It's a big hoax.

Speaker 6 ( 53:40 ):

… told you this was a hoax? What evidence have you seen of that?

President Trump ( 53:42 ):

It's not the attorney general. No, I know it's a hoax. It started by Democrats. It's been run by the Democrats for four years. You had Christopher Wray and these characters and Comey before him. And it's a bad group. It started actually … Look at the Steele dossier that turned out to be a total hoax. The 51 agents, the so-called intelligence agents. It was a hoax. It's all been a big hoax. It's perpetrated by the Democrats and some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net, and so they try and do the Democrat's work. The Democrats are good for nothing other than these hoaxes. They're bad for policy, they're bad for picking candidates that can get elected. Like in New York, we have a communist running. He may get elected too, actually. But he'll destroy the city. No, no. I call it the Epstein hoax.

( 54:34 ) Takes a lot of time and effort. Instead of talking about the great achievements we've had. A great gentleman, yesterday, as you know, went on CNBC and he made the statement that Trump may go down as the greatest president of all in the United States. And instead of talking about the things we've achieved. We've had tremendous achievement. They're wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems who died three, four years ago. I'd rather talk about the success we have with the economy, the best we've ever had, and all of the things we've done, including the Middle East. You see it. Instead, they want to talk about the Epstein hoax. And the sad part is it's people that are really doing the Democrat's work. They're stupid people. Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker 19 ( 55:26 ):

Mr. President. There's lots of reports coming into this meeting that you planned on firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Market's reaction?

President Trump ( 55:33 ):

Right. Those are reports, but they're not true.

Speaker 19 ( 55:35 ):

So what would be useful to know, are you committed to picking someone from the outside. Are you going to interview individuals that are on the board?

President Trump ( 55:41 ):

So many people that want that job. I have people that I've known a long time, they're calling me begging for the job. You know what you need there? A smart person with common sense. But you need a very smart person for that job. I think it's one of the easiest jobs in government. You show up once a month and you make a statement about where the economy is going, and we're going to raise or lower interest rates.

Speaker 19 ( 56:03 ):

You have to deliver a job though.

President Trump ( 56:03 ):

It's probably the easiest job I've ever seen. That's why I'm trying to figure why does he want to expand and add more people. He's going to add more economists to tell him what to do. But the economists … I was right. All the economists were wrong. They admitted it this morning. Quiet, quiet, quiet. Go ahead.

Speaker 13 ( 56:23 ):

You mentioned fraud in an earlier answer. Are you saying you want to investigate the Fed Chair for fraud related to this renovation?

President Trump ( 56:29 ):

Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to on rebuilding. I didn't see him as being the kind of guy that would want to have parks, rooftop parks and everything else on top of buildings. But who wants to spend that money for the Fed? The Fed is supposed to sit there and say where interest rates are going and a couple of other very easy things to do. And he spent two and a half billion dollars. I think he's got some problems.

Speaker 10 ( 57:01 ):

Mr. President, Mr. President.

Speaker 11 ( 57:01 ):

Mr. President.

Speaker 14 ( 57:02 ):

Thank you, sir. You also recorded a monthly surplus in the month of June.

President Trump ( 57:06 ):

25 billion dollars, 40 billion.

Speaker 14 ( 57:08 ):

A ton of money. With these new tariff rates coming into effect on August 1st, be bringing in even more tariff revenue. Specifically, how much revenue do you think we can consistently bring in from these tariffs and how big of a game changer is this, not only for the economy, but also fiscal responsibility?

President Trump ( 57:23 ):

Well, we're going to be bringing in … Already we've brought in over a hundred billion dollars. We'll be bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars. And the tariffs really haven't kicked in that much other than automobiles and steel. August 1st is a big day. August 1st is when very substantial money comes into our country. We've made deals with a lot of great places, but we had one yesterday that was announced. We have another one coming up maybe with India. I don't know. We're in negotiation. When I send out a letter, that's a deal. In other words, that's a deal. They don't want to ever say that, "Oh, how many deals have you made?" The best deal we can make is to send out a letter and the letter says that you'll pay 30%, 35 percent, 25 percent, 20%. In one case, 50%. Brazil.

( 58:15 ) And because what they're doing to their former president is disgraceful. I know the former president. He fought like hell for the people of Brazil. That I can tell you. And I believe he's an honest man. I think what they're doing to him is terrible. So yeah, we have some pretty good deals to announce, but every time we send out a letter, that's the deal. The big one really is going to be on the 150 countries that we're really not negotiating with. And they're smaller. We don't do much business with them. Because you have a lot of countries. You have over 200 countries and a lot of people don't know this. But we'll have well over 150 countries that we're just going to send a notice of payment out and the notice of payment is going to say what the tariff … And it's all going to be the same for everyone for that group.

( 59:10 ) They're not big countries and they don't do that much business. It's not like the ones that we've agreed with, like China, like Japan, where we're negotiating with them. But I think probably we'll live by the letter with Japan. We're very close to a deal with India when they open it up. Indonesia yesterday was … It wasn't an open country. Now it is. And they have tremendous copper, quality copper, and probably the most copper. And we made a deal with Indonesia. We pay no tariff, zero, and we have total access to trade. That's a phenomenal deal for our companies. And we've agreed with them as you know, on 19%. They pay 19%. And it's a good deal for them, it's a good deal for us in that case. But we have a number of them coming up. But overall, we're doing well and we're taking in a lot of money, a lot of money. We have the number one … We have the most oil of any country in the world, even more than them, which is hard to believe. But we have a little larger piece of land.

Crown Prince ( 01:00:16 ):

You do sir.

President Trump ( 01:00:17 ):

But we're number one in the world in oil and we're drilling. And today it hit $64 a barrel, which is great. And that will help stop wars actually if you want to know the truth. It's going to help stop wars and we hope to get it down a little bit more. But we have oil down to $2, $2.25, $2.50 in numerous states. We hit one at a dollar 98 a gallon. And that's a great thing. That's one of the reasons that inflation is in check.

( 01:00:49 ) When you can do that, you stop inflation. What Biden did is he ended our policies, went to his policies. He didn't have a policy. Some lunatic around the desk had a policy. Whoever operated the auto pen had a policy, which is by the way, I think the biggest scandal. That's the scandal they should be talking about, not Jeffrey Epstein. The scandal you should be talking about is the auto pen because I think it's the biggest scandal, one of them in American history.

Speaker 10 ( 01:01:20 ):

Mr. President, Mr. President.

President Trump ( 01:01:22 ):

So the economy is doing really well and people are seeing it. Yeah.

Speaker 11 ( 01:01:28 ):

Mr. President, Mr. President.

Speaker 15 ( 01:01:30 ):

Will you ask Attorney General Pam Bondi to release more documents to finally put this controversy to bed?

President Trump ( 01:01:35 ):

Yeah, whatever is credible, she can release. If a document is credible, if a document's there that is credible, she can release. I think it's good.

Speaker 15 ( 01:01:45 ):

Have you talked to her about it?

President Trump ( 01:01:47 ):

But it's just a subject. He's dead. He's gone. And all it is the Republicans. Certain Republicans got duped by the Democrats and they're following a Democrat playbook and no different than Russia, Russia, Russia and all the other hoaxes. They're started by the Democrats and some Republicans. In this case I was surprised. But they got duped.

Speaker 15 ( 01:02:17 ):

Have you talked about it with her the last few days?

Speaker 16 ( 01:02:19 ):

First of all, a number of your high-ranking officials, whether there's been your FBI director or Pam Bondi, they have made some inconsistent statements in the past. You've had-

President Trump ( 01:02:28 ):

Well, I don't know. I can't speak about him, but I can say that Pam Bondi, I really think that she's done very good. She says I gave you all the credible information, and if she finds any more credible information, she'll give that too. What more can she do than that? Honestly, what more can she do?

Speaker 16 ( 01:02:46 ):

Have you talked about it?

President Trump ( 01:02:47 ):

And we do have bigger problems. We have problems with millions of illegal people that came in here and their killers and murderers. We have 11,888 murderers that were allowed into our country by Biden, sleepy Joe Biden, stupid Joe Biden. He allowed him into our country. And you know what? We got to do something about it. She's got a lot of things she's working on and it's very sad that somebody can just get waylaid, just get waylaid. But I think she's doing a great job.

Speaker 10 ( 01:03:16 ):

Mr. President, Mr. President.

Speaker 17 ( 01:03:21 ):

In your two sessions this morning, you mentioned past supporters when you were talking about the Epstein issue. Does that mean that you are effectively disowning any supporters who are now [inaudible 01:03:31]?

President Trump ( 01:03:30 ):

I lost a lot of faith in certain people. Yeah. Because they got duped by the Democrats. The Democrats are good for nothing. They've done a terrible job. They almost destroyed our country. If I didn't get elected, all these numbers you're hearing about, they found $25 billion and another 25 is coming in and hundreds of billions of dollars is pouring into our country. And we just got the biggest tax cut in history. We just got the biggest regulation cuts in history. There'll be no tax on tips. There'll be no tax on social security. There'll be no tax on overtime. There'll be no tax on so many other things. You're allowed to deduct your interest from a car payment. That's never happened before. You borrow interest. You borrow money to buy a car if the car is made in America. And by the way, factories are being built all over America, car factories, AI factories.

( 01:04:21 ) But you get a deduction on your interest. Nobody ever thought of that before. It never happened before. And these are the things that they should be talking about. The Big Beautiful Bill is one of the greatest pieces of legislation ever in this country. And the Democrats have nothing to combat it. So they say, "Oh, it's death, death." Oh, that's good. And then they give it to the fake news, which is you and a few others. And the fake news talks about the bill is death. The bill is actually life. The bill is life and it saves our country. This bill is incredible. Look at the results already. So we have $16 trillion being invested in our country. And this great gentleman and his family just came in with another billions of dollars. And if he didn't like the country, if he didn't like where we were going … He's very smart.

( 01:05:14 ) He'd come, maybe he'd come, maybe he wouldn't even come. I think maybe you wouldn't even come. You would save your time. But it's one of those things. But if he didn't like where this country was, he wouldn't be investing billions of dollars in this country. But think of it, $16 trillion more than has ever been even contemplated before. And we haven't even started yet. So that's what I want to talk about. I want to talk about the success. And the Democrats have nothing to show for what they do. They almost destroyed. They allowed 25 million people to come into our country. Gang members, jailbirds from all over the world, not South America, from all over the world. They allowed them to come into our country from mental institutions and insane asylums. Just walk right through. They couldn't come into your country. They couldn't come into any country in the world except our country.

( 01:06:07 ) And they came in from the worst places, gang members, drug dealers, they all came in … Turn it off, please. They all came in. And I'm doing something about it. We have it under check right now. We got rid of a lot of the murderers already. Some of them we put in our prisons because they are so bad we don't want to take a chance in putting them in a foreign prison and ave them come back. But we've done a great job. Our country is in great shape. We literally have the hottest country anywhere in the world right now. And it's true what the king said, what a lot of people said. We were a dead country. One year ago, we were a dead country. We were laughed at all over the world. We had Afghanistan. We've had horrible embarrassment, most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.

( 01:07:01 ) Look what happened with Russia and Ukraine. That should have never happened. Look what happened with Israel. That would've never happened. Hamas had no money. Iran had no money. There was no money to do an attack like that. All these things that happened that wouldn't have happened if you had good leadership. And that's what you should be talking about. Thank you very much.

( 01:07:19 ) Thank you.
