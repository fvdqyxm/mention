Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Hello, everybody.

Speaker 2 ( 00:02 ):

Hello, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 00:03 ):

Nice to see you.

Speaker 3 ( 00:03 ):

Nice to see you.

The Daily Mail ( 00:06 ):

Nice to see you.

Donald Trump ( 00:07 ):

Hello. I haven't seen you in a while.

Speaker 3 ( 00:07 ):

[inaudible 00:00:09]

Donald Trump ( 00:09 ):

5 million. For $5 million this could be yours. That was the first of the cards. See that? Do you know what that card is?

Speaker 3 ( 00:16 ):

Gold Card.

Donald Trump ( 00:19 ):

It's the Gold Card. The Trump card Gold Card.

Speaker 3 ( 00:23 ):

Who's the first buyer?

Donald Trump ( 00:23 ):

Me. I'm the first.

Speaker 3 ( 00:27 ):

Who's second?

Donald Trump ( 00:28 ):

I don't know, but I'm the first buyer. It'll be out in about less than two weeks, probably. Pretty exciting.

The Daily Mail ( 00:37 ):

You ready for some questions?

Donald Trump ( 00:40 ):

Anybody want to buy one? Okay, let's go.

Speaker 3 ( 00:47 ):

First, we'd love to get your reaction, sir, to what's going on in the financial markets today.

Donald Trump ( 00:52 ):

Well, I mean, it's to be expected where this is a patient that was very sick. We really inherited a terrible economy, as you know, with a lot of problems, including the loss of manufacturing and plants closed up all over the country. We've lost 90,000 plants since NAFTA. If you think of that, 90,000, it's not even believable. And about 6 million jobs. And so, it was a sick patient that went through an operation on Liberation Day, and it's going to be a booming country, a very booming country. It's going to be amazing, actually. And we see it because we have trillions of dollars committed to come in. Trillions.

Speaker 5 ( 01:40 ):

Sir, can I ask you, when you say that it was an operation and the patient's healthy now, does that mean you see us as kind of towards the high water mark in terms of how much how-

Donald Trump ( 01:50 ):

Operation, sure. The operation's over, and now we let it settle in. You see the plants are starting to construction already. We have many plants. Indiana, a massive auto plant. The Honda, and we have so many plants, and they'll be under construction. And as they start to build, you're going to see a lot of construction jobs and you're going to see a lot of jobs when they open.

Speaker 5 ( 02:18 ):

Does that mean chips and pharma tariffs are not on the table?

Donald Trump ( 02:21 ):

They're starting very soon. The chips are starting very soon. The pharma is going to be starting to come in, I think, at a level that you haven't really seen before. We are looking at pharma right now, pharmaceuticals as a separate category, and we'll be announcing that sometime in the near future, not too distant future.

Speaker 3 ( 02:45 ):

Are you negotiating?

Donald Trump ( 02:46 ):

That's under review right now.

Speaker 3 ( 02:47 ):

Are you negotiating with partners currently?

Donald Trump ( 02:50 ):

What we have is we have a set of tariffs based on what they've been charging us. That's reciprocal. And those tariffs have come in, and every country's called us. That's the beauty of what we do. We put ourselves in the driver's seat. If we would have asked some of these countries, almost most of these countries to do us a favor, they would have said no. Now they'll do anything for us. But we have tariffs. They've been set, and it's going to make our country very rich.

Speaker 3 ( 03:23 ):

Are you open to deals with these countries if they're calling you?

Donald Trump ( 03:27 ):

Well, it depends. If somebody said that, "We're going to give you something that's so phenomenal," as long as they're giving us something that's good. For instance, with TikTok as an example, we have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say, "We'll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariff?"

( 03:47 ) The tariffs give us great power to negotiate, always have. I've used them very well in the first administration, as you saw, but now we're taking it to a whole new level because it's a worldwide situation. And it's very exciting to see.

( 04:05 ) And what it's done is driven a lot of great companies to our country. And you're going to see construction starting all over. I already got a couple of calls from Lee Zeldin from Environmental. He's got some big plans to approve. Really big plans.

The Daily Mail ( 04:21 ):

How long will it take to get American manufacturing to where you would like to see it?

Donald Trump ( 04:27 ):

Well, let's say it's a two-year process. They start a plant, and they're big plants. We're giving them approval to also, in many cases, to build the electric facility with it. So, you have electric generation and the plant, and they're big plants.

( 04:41 ) Now, the good news is a lot of money for them, and they can build them fast, but they're still very big plants. So, I'd always say it would take a year and a half to two years.

Speaker 6 ( 04:50 ):

Mr. President, can I ask you about the NSAID?

Donald Trump ( 04:52 ):

They've already started some of them.

Speaker 7 ( 04:54 ):

Have you been following the New York City mayor's race? And specifically Andrew Cuomo is now the front runner according to the polls. How do you feel about that? Do you think you could have a good relationship with the mayor, Andrew Cuomo?

Donald Trump ( 05:04 ):

Well, I've always gotten along with him. We had our ins and outs a little bit. We did a great job for him. Remember we built the convention center rooms for him. He didn't use them, unfortunately. And we sent the Mercy ship. We sent the really magnificent hospital ship, but they didn't use it. But we always had a pretty good relationship.

Speaker 7 ( 05:24 ):

Are you going to make an endorsement in that race?

Donald Trump ( 05:26 ):

Well, it's not something I'm thinking about yet. Is he thinking about running?

Speaker 8 ( 05:30 ):

Russia and Ukraine, there's a Russian envoy in town for some meetings. Can you give us an update on how that's going?

Donald Trump ( 05:38 ):

We do. We have an envoy from Russia. We're talking about it. We'd like to see that stop as soon as possible because thousands of people are being killed a week. Soldiers, mostly soldiers, and Ukrainian soldiers and Russian soldiers. And you're losing 2,000, 3,000 sometimes a week. So, we're spearheading the drive to get it done. Europe has not been successful in dealing with President Putin, but I think I will be successful.

Speaker 6 ( 06:08 ):

Sir, I want to ask you about the NSAID. How many staffers were let go and why? Your National Security Council, how many staffers?

Donald Trump ( 06:15 ):

There were some. There were some. Always we're going to let go of people. People that we don't like or people that we don't think can do the job or people that may have loyalties to somebody else. You'll always have that.

The Daily Mail ( 06:29 ):

Sir, you mentioned in Yahoo recently, Israel has now talked about staying in Gaza doing long-term occupation. Has anything changed in regard to the US Gaza-Israel plans?

Donald Trump ( 06:39 ):

I spoke to him today, as a matter of fact. And I think he's going to be coming to our country sometime in the not-too-distant future, maybe next week. And we'll speak about Israel. We'll speak about what's going on. That's another thing we'd like to get solved, and I think we will get it solved. I think he very well may be coming next [inaudible 00:07:02]. Benjamin Netanyahu.

Speaker 5 ( 07:03 ):

Sir, could I follow up on your earlier comment about TikTok? You said that the Chinese might be willing to agree to approve that sale in exchange for tariff relief. Is that something that you've floated to them or you've heard from them?

Donald Trump ( 07:15 ):

No, I'm just using that as an example. Let's say we had a problem with TikTok, and let's say China wasn't going to approve, and we could use tariffs in order to get it approved. You give them something in return.

Speaker 3 ( 07:28 ):

What's the update on the deal negotiations for TikTok?

Donald Trump ( 07:31 ):

We're very close to a deal with a very good group of people for TikTok.

Speaker 3 ( 07:36 ):

Larry Ellison? Is it multiple investors?

Donald Trump ( 07:39 ):

It's multiple.

Speaker 8 ( 07:39 ):

And then did the last minute bids kind of throw things into disarray for you, or do you have your strategy completely locked up on who's going to-

Donald Trump ( 07:45 ):

Which last minute?

Speaker 8 ( 07:47 ):

On acquiring TikTok?

Donald Trump ( 07:49 ):

No, I think that China maybe will call and say, "Well, we're upset with the tariffs." And maybe they want to get something a little bit in order to get TikTok approved. Who knows?

Speaker 3 ( 08:02 ):

Is there plans underway to speak to Xi?

Donald Trump ( 08:05 ):

I have no knowledge of that, but that's the kind of thing that we're [inaudible 00:08:07].

Speaker 7 ( 08:07 ):

About Israel, can you give us any update on the Palestinian relocation plan? Are we talking to any countries?

Donald Trump ( 08:12 ):

We're going to try and solve the Gaza problem. It's been a problem for many years, for many, many decades. It's been a big problem. I've met with, as you know, a lot of the hostages. It's a terrible situation, but if you notice, hostages are being released now, and that's happened only since I got involved. So, we have hostages being released. Quite a few, actually.

Speaker 7 ( 08:37 ):

Are you still committed to the relocation?

Donald Trump ( 08:39 ):

I'd like to get as many hostages as we can. And then Gaza is a very important thing. It's been under siege for many, many years. It's a shame. It's a shame. A lot of people die in Gaza. Gaza's been a place we have a lot of people die. A lot of bad things happen in Gaza. We'll see what we can do about it.

The Daily Mail ( 09:01 ):

About dinner tonight, can you tell us about it? Who's going to be there? Are there any leaders?

Donald Trump ( 09:04 ):

So, dinner tonight is sort of a, I have a couple of them, actually. But a lot of it's based around charity, it's at Doral, and we raise a lot of money for charities. They're also having one of the big professional golf tournaments, the LIV, and that'll take place over the next few days at Doral from, I guess tomorrow until they have, I think they have a Pro-Am right now.

( 09:32 ) But I'll be speaking tonight, I think I'm making a speech to the players. Great players, some of the best players in the world. And ultimately, hopefully the two tours are going to merge. That would be good. I'm involved in that too. But hopefully we're going to get the two tours to merge. You have the PGA Tour, you have the LIV tour, and I think having that merge would be a great thing.

Speaker 2 ( 09:54 ):

Mr. President, about the tariffs, do you have any message for the American businesses that might feel the impact of any reciprocal tariffs coming from the EU, for example, or from other countries?

Donald Trump ( 10:06 ):

I think it's going to all work out. Remember, there are no tariffs. If you build your plant or you build your product, make your product in the US. And so, a lot of people, I mean, there's going to be a transition period because they're going to be building instead of paying tariffs to some other place. But there are no tariffs, if you think. There are no tariffs. All you have to do is build, make your product in the United States.

( 10:31 ) And a lot of people are doing that. They're moving, like the auto companies. I know I spoke to two of the four or five that are really active, and they've already started moving their parts, making things out of Mexico, out of Canada and into the United States.

Speaker 3 ( 10:48 ):

Did you speak to any CEOs today?

Speaker 5 ( 10:50 ):

Sir, do you have a sense of us how long Elon Musk's mission will last and when he will depart?

Donald Trump ( 10:55 ):

Well, Elon is fantastic, and he's a patriot. And I think it's a shame what they're doing with his car company. And a great car. It's a great car, a great product, and it tells you what a patriot he is. He's amazing.

( 11:11 ) No, I mean, as long as he'd like. I like smart people, and he's a smart person. I also like him personally. When he endorsed me, that's when I really got to know him. I knew him a little bit before that, but not much. And then he endorsed me, and it was a very strong, embracing endorsement, as we all know. And I would say Elon will stay for a certain period of time, and then he's going to want to get back to his businesses full-time.

( 11:36 ) But he's done a fantastic job. We found hundreds of, think of it, just hundreds of, we've found millions of dollars of fraud and abuse and waste. And they're still going. I mean, they're going strong on the finding. They found something today that's horrible. It's horrible.

The Daily Mail ( 11:55 ):

What was it?

Donald Trump ( 11:56 ):

So, what they found, you'll find out very soon. What they found is incredible. And I give him a lot of credit. He's got some very smart people with him.

Speaker 5 ( 12:05 ):

Do you think he could-

Donald Trump ( 12:06 ):

And they're working very closely with our secretaries and the people that are the heads of [inaudible 00:12:10].

Speaker 8 ( 12:10 ):

Do you think you would appoint him to another position once his 130 days-

Donald Trump ( 12:14 ):

I would. I think Elon's great, but he also has a company to run or a number of companies to run. That he can do this, that he can find the time, he loves the country, that's why he does it. But we're in no rush. But there'll be a point at which time Elon's going to have to leave.

Speaker 3 ( 12:32 ):

Sir, you mentioned the auto companies.

Speaker 8 ( 12:33 ):

[inaudible 00:12:33] a specific date on when he's-

Donald Trump ( 12:34 ):

I would think a few months.

The Daily Mail ( 12:37 ):

Even when Elon leaves and goes back to being CEO, will DOGE stick around in some kind of capacity?

Donald Trump ( 12:44 ):

Yeah, it'll still, DOGE itself, yeah. At some point, just so you understand, I don't want you to get it wrong. I want Elon to stay as long as possible. Number one, I like him. Number two, he's doing a great job. Number three, he is a patriot. That's why he's doing this. And it's very costly for him. So, I want him to stay as long as possible, but there'll be a point where he's going to have to leave. And when he does, the secretaries will take totally over, and DOGE will stay active. We have a lot of smart people. A lot of those people, I believe, are going to go into the agencies, and they'll work on it from the inside.

Speaker 3 ( 13:27 ):

You mentioned auto companies that you've been speaking with. Have you spoken to any executives today?

Donald Trump ( 13:31 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 3 ( 13:32 ):

Who?

Donald Trump ( 13:33 ):

I don't want to say who, but I speak to a lot of the auto executives. But we have much more than autos. We have chips coming in, we have steel coming in.

Speaker 3 ( 13:40 ):

But do they call [inaudible 00:13:41]?

Donald Trump ( 13:41 ):

The steel factories. The steel factories are opening up and expanding at levels that people have not seen also.

Speaker 7 ( 13:48 ):

Can you tell us a little bit about your meeting with Laura Loomer and Mike Waltz today and how that came about?

Donald Trump ( 13:55 ):

So, Laura Loomer is a very good patriot. She's a very strong person, and I saw her yesterday for a little while. She makes recommendations of things and people, and sometimes I listen to those recommendations, like I do with everybody. I listen to everybody, and then I make a decision. But I saw her yesterday. She was at the ceremony. And she'll always have something to say, usually very constructive.

Speaker 3 ( 14:24 ):

What did she recommend?

Donald Trump ( 14:27 ):

She recommended certain people for jobs.

Speaker 8 ( 14:30 ):

Adding to the administration, not-

Donald Trump ( 14:32 ):

Adding.

Speaker 8 ( 14:32 ):

But not firing?

Donald Trump ( 14:33 ):

Well, she'll recommend that too, but yesterday she recommended some people for jobs.

Speaker 8 ( 14:38 ):

Did she have anything to do with the NSAIDs who were ousted?

Donald Trump ( 14:42 ):

No, no, not at all.

Speaker 8 ( 14:44 ):

Do you know how many, sir? Do you know how many from the NSAID?

Donald Trump ( 14:46 ):

Not many.

Speaker 8 ( 14:48 ):

Was it five? A dozen?

Donald Trump ( 14:50 ):

I really don't know. There were a couple there.

Speaker 7 ( 14:53 ):

Who did Laura recommend hiring?

Donald Trump ( 14:55 ):

Well, I don't want to say that, but she's recommended some good people over the years. She's been in the party a long time. She's done a good job.

Speaker 5 ( 15:03 ):

Do you trust your national security staff is doing what you want them to do?

Donald Trump ( 15:07 ):

Yeah. Sure, I do. We've done very well. We've had big success with the Houthis, as you probably know. Nobody's been able to do it like us. And they were shooting the boats out of the water. They were sinking ships. That's what they were doing. They get a big charge out of sinking ships. And unfortunately, they're associated with Iran very closely, so they have to stop that. But we've hit them very hard, and we've been hitting them very hard.

The Daily Mail ( 15:33 ):

Did you talk to Congresswoman Luna about her resolution to get maternity-

Donald Trump ( 15:38 ):

Congresswoman who?

The Daily Mail ( 15:38 ):

The congresswoman about her resolution to allow proxy voting for new mothers? Did you speak to her?

Donald Trump ( 15:45 ):

I did. I did. And I would say this, I guess there's two sides to it, right? It's a little controversial. I don't know why it's controversial. I think she's great. Anna.

The Daily Mail ( 15:57 ):

Do you support her movement?

Donald Trump ( 15:59 ):

I think that, and I'm going to let the speaker make the decision, but I like the idea of being able to, if you're having a baby, I think you should be able to call in and vote. I'm in favor of that, but I understand some people aren't. I'm not involved in the issue, but I did. I spoke to Anna yesterday, and she and some people feel strongly about it. And I would agree with it. Yeah.

Speaker 3 ( 16:28 ):

Sir, you mentioned Iran. They have come out and said if they're going to sit down with the US, they want to use an intermediary. And I believe the US wanted direct talks. Would you still be willing to talk to them via an intermediary?

Donald Trump ( 16:37 ):

I think it's better if we have direct talks. I think it goes faster. And you understand the other side a lot better than if you go through intermediaries. They wanted to use intermediaries. I don't think that's necessarily true anymore. I think they're concerned. I think they feel vulnerable, and I don't want them to feel that way. And I think they want to meet, yeah. Iran, they're talking about Iran.

Speaker 3 ( 17:03 ):

You said you don't think they want to use intermediaries anymore. Did they send another letter?

Donald Trump ( 17:07 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 3 ( 17:07 ):

Did the UAE let you know about this?

Donald Trump ( 17:10 ):

Yeah, I know for a fact. I think they'd like to have direct talks.

Speaker 8 ( 17:14 ):

Can you say anything about what the letter said from Iran?

Donald Trump ( 17:17 ):

No. I'm just telling you, I think they want to have, forget about letters. I think they want to have direct talks.

Speaker 3 ( 17:24 ):

When can it happen?

Speaker 8 ( 17:25 ):

On Pete Hegseth and this IG investigation, do you want to weigh in on that?

Donald Trump ( 17:29 ):

What is it?

The Daily Mail ( 17:30 ):

There's an IG investigation into the Secretary of Defense's use of the Signal app.

Donald Trump ( 17:37 ):

Oh, you're bringing that up again. Don't bring that up again. Your editors probably. That's such a wasted story. So, what else?

The Daily Mail ( 17:43 ):

Chinese farmland. Do you have some plans for Chinese ownership of farmland in the US?

Donald Trump ( 17:50 ):

We look at that all the time. And look, I have a very good relationship with China and with the president, who I have a lot of respect for, President Xi. So, we look at that all the time. The farmland. It's been an issue for years. It's been. People have talked about it for years, but I have a lot of respect for China, and I have a lot of respect for President Xi.

Speaker 5 ( 18:08 ):

When's the last time you talked to President Xi?

Donald Trump ( 18:11 ):

I speak to him… Doesn't matter when, but I speak to him.

Speaker 8 ( 18:14 ):

Have you talked to the Zelenskyy recently?

Donald Trump ( 18:18 ):

Not too long ago. Yeah.

Speaker 8 ( 18:20 ):

How did that go?

Donald Trump ( 18:22 ):

Good. I think he's ready to make a deal.

Speaker 8 ( 18:23 ):

No progress at all other than that?

Donald Trump ( 18:27 ):

I think a lot of progress. No, he's ready to make a deal, and I think that President Putin is ready to make a deal. And then you'll stop the killing of thousands of young people a week.

Speaker 3 ( 18:38 ):

Did Kirill Dmitriev say that to his counterparts in the US?

Donald Trump ( 18:43 ):

Who?

Speaker 3 ( 18:44 ):

Kirill Dmitriev, the Russian negotiator that's in Washington right now?

Donald Trump ( 18:47 ):

I don't talk about specific people. I just will tell you that there's a lot of good conversation going on about Ukraine-Russia.

Speaker 2 ( 18:55 ):

Have you given your approval for the UK's deal over the Chagos Island that Prime Minister Starmer and you discussed?

Donald Trump ( 19:01 ):

I'm talking to the Prime Minister about it, and we'll see how that turns out. We have a very good dialogue going. And I think he was very happy about how we treated them on tariffs.

The Daily Mail ( 19:13 ):

Sir, a lot of people were upset about how-

Donald Trump ( 19:16 ):

Who are you with?

The Daily Mail ( 19:17 ):

The Daily Mail. A lot of people were upset today about how their 401Ks were doing. Do you have investments? Were you looking at them? Are you worried?

Donald Trump ( 19:34 ):

I think our markets are going to boom. We've got to give it a little chance. But we're taking in jobs, and we're taking in industry and we're taking in trillions of dollars. I think our markets are going to boom. We've got to give it a little bit of time. But they've already started construction on numerous plants. Soon it'll be many, many plants. All over the country they're going in.

Speaker 8 ( 19:46 ):

Have you looked or checked your 401K?

Donald Trump ( 19:46 ):

So, you've got to give that a little time. I haven't checked my 401K. Thank you very much, everybody.

Speaker 3 ( 19:53 ):

Sir, sir, one question on the Fed. A lot of money markets are now pricing in more fed cuts this year.

Donald Trump ( 19:57 ):

One thing I like is interest rates going down. I see that happening. And interest-

Speaker 3 ( 20:01 ):

[inaudible 00:20:02] zero percent.

Donald Trump ( 20:02 ):

You know what's beautiful is interest rates go down. I like groceries going down, I like eggs going down, if you look at it. And very importantly, the gasoline prices are going down. So, a lot of good things are happening. Thank you very much.

Speaker 7 ( 20:17 ):

Thank for your time, Mr. President.
