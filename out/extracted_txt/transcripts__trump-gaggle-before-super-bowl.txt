Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Hello, everybody.

Speaker 2 ( 00:01 ):

Hello, sir.

Donald Trump ( 00:03 ):

How are you? Nice to see you. Are you all set? We're flying over right now, we're flying over a thing called the Gulf of America, and I'm signing a proclamation and perhaps you could define that.

Speaker 3 ( 00:19 ):

This is a proclamation declaring today, February 9th, 2025, as the first ever Gulf of America Day. This follows the president's executive order issuing a name change from the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.

Donald Trump ( 00:34 ):

And we're flying right over it right now. So we thought this would be appropriate, even bigger than the Super Bowl. This is a big thing. And almost everybody now has assented to that-

Speaker 4 ( 00:48 ):

Attention on board, ladies and gentlemen, if you could please direct your attention out the right side of the aircraft, Air Force One is currently in international waters, the first time in history flying over the recently renamed Gulf of America. Please enjoy the flight and we are now about to head westbound to Super Bowl LIX.

Donald Trump ( 01:07 ):

Wow. He did that well. Isn't that nice? Make America great again, right? That's what we care about. Okay, here we go. So this is a famous pen now, and we'll put it with something, I'll ask you to do whatever you think we should do with it, Mr. Secretary. Do you want to talk about Doug, secretary of the interior and also working with Chris Wright on extracting vast amounts of oil and gas and making our country rich? Would you like to say something, Doug?

Doug Burgum ( 01:56 ):

Well, with the Gulf of America, this historic day, we want to thank President Trump, his executive order is what set this in motion. We signed a secretarial order as secretary of interior directing the US Geologic Survey, who is responsible for the database, which is the geographic names informational system. And so just prior to this signing, if you will, the button was pushed. It became official with this proclamation to call today Gulf of America Day, but now it's going out. As we're sitting here right now, our team is calling all the map providers. So Google Maps, Apple Maps, all the map people, that change will take effect this afternoon to Gulf of America. So, again, fantastic. Thank you, President Trump, for setting this all in motion with your executive order. It's an exciting, exciting, fun day and great to do this as we're flying over the Gulf of America.

Donald Trump ( 02:53 ):

We thought it would be very appropriate. We thought it would be appropriate. Catherine, thank you very much for being here. You've been a very important part of his life. And who knows what would've happened to him without you. It might not have been good. Here you go. Okay.

Speaker 6 ( 03:10 ):

Have you talked to Mexico about this? Did they-

Donald Trump ( 03:15 ):

Actually, interestingly, I've never spoken to them about it. It was our call and I have not spoken to them about… I've spoken about many other things, but I haven't really talked to them about this. They have never brought it up. I'm a little surprised at that, but they've never brought it up.

Speaker 7 ( 03:30 ):

Sir, can you tell us about your conversation with Vladimir Putin?

Donald Trump ( 03:33 ):

I don't want to hear that name. We're trying to end that war. [inaudible 00:03:36] that would've never happened if I were president. Would've never happened. But we're making progress, but I can't tell you.

Speaker 8 ( 03:44 ):

You suffered a couple of court losses, Mr. President, and JD Vance said judges aren't allowed to control the executive power. What's your take on that?

Donald Trump ( 03:50 ):

Well, we're going to see what happens. We have a long way to go. And we're talking about fraud, waste, abuse, and when a president can't look for fraud, and waste, and abuse, we don't have a country anymore. So we're very disappointed with the judges that would make such a ruling. But we have a long way to go. We have to find all of the fraud that's going on. We have tremendous fraud, tremendous waste, and tremendous abuse, and theft, by the way. And the day you're not allowed to look for theft and fraud, et cetera, then we don't have much of a country. So no judge should frankly be allowed to make that decision. It's a disgrace.

Speaker 9 ( 04:32 ):

Mr. President, Gulf of America, Canada, Greenland, Gaza, all these are very muscular foreign policy. How does this align with America First?

Donald Trump ( 04:42 ):

Because it makes us bigger, stronger, and better, and more protective. We need Greenland because of national security, international security, world security, world fees, and we'll have to do that. Canada, we'll see what happens with Canada, but the people of Canada would be paying less than half of the tax. If you look at the tax, they're going to be paying less than half the tax. They don't pay very much for military, and the reason they don't pay much is they assume that we're going to protect them. That's not an assumption they can make because why are we protecting another country?

( 05:18 ) Now I love the people of Canada, we have a great relationship, but if they became our 51st state, it'd be the greatest thing they could ever do. It'd be unbelievable. It would be a cherished state. And think of how beautiful that country would be without that artificial line running right through it. Somebody drew it many years ago with a ruler, just a line. You look at how beautiful that is, wow, it would be very exciting, but if you look at Canada and would be cherished as a 51st state. They don't pay their share of military and NATO. They pay very little for military. They're not protected at all. And the reason is they think we're going to protect them. The other thing is we subsidize them to the tune of about $200 billion a year. If we stop doing that, if we stop allowing them to make cars through tariffs and other things, cars, trucks, et cetera, what they make, they're not viable as a country.

Speaker 10 ( 06:13 ):

So would you agree that it's a more aggressive foreign policy than your first term? And why is that?

Donald Trump ( 06:19 ):

It's more aggressive. It's better. Why? Because I think I've had a lot of experience. And in my first term, I was fighting everybody because they were very aggressive toward me. I always said survival and taking care of the country, not necessarily in that order. But I had to take care of the country, but I had a bunch of lunatics like Pelosi and all of these people, they fought me, fought me, fought me, and we won. And I had a lot of other things that were going on there. This time, it's much more… They've lost their confidence. I think they've lost the respect of the American people with men participating in women's sports with open borders, with transgender for everybody, for all the things that they're doing is so bad when you allow people to empty their jails into your country with prisoners, killers, their mental institutions, and insane asylums into our country.

( 07:18 ) This is what they're doing. When you allow gang members from Venezuela, but many other countries coming into our country, we're getting them all out now. They've lost their credibility, but they've also lost their confidence. So I have more time to do what I want to do. So we're making our country larger, we're making our country stronger. And in the case of Canada, if this should happen, I don't know how they can do it without us. Because without the US, Canada really doesn't have a country. They do almost all of their business with us. And if we say we want our cars to be made in Detroit, with a stroke of a pen, I can do that. And other things in addition to that, would not allow Canada to be a viable country.

Speaker 11 ( 08:05 ):

Mr. President, you said you're going to honor first responders today, but you pardoned hundreds of people who assaulted first responders. Why did you do that?

Donald Trump ( 08:14 ):

Who? [inaudible 00:08:15]?

Speaker 11 ( 08:16 ):

You were going to meet with first responders today, but you pardoned people who assaulted first responders-

Donald Trump ( 08:22 ):

I pardoned people that were assaulted themselves. They were assaulted by our government. I pardoned J6 people who were assaulted by our government. That's who assaulted… And they were treated unfairly. There's never been a group of people in this country, outside of maybe one instance that I can think of, but I won't get into it, that were treated more horribly than the people of J6. So, no, they didn't assault. They were assaulted. And what I did was a great thing for humanity. They were treated very, very unfairly. There's never been an incident like it.

Speaker 12 ( 09:01 ):

Two more policy questions. On Putin, again, you realize if you don't clarify that everyone's going to assume you're talking to President Putin regularly, are you-

Donald Trump ( 09:11 ):

[inaudible 00:09:10]. It makes sense, but I don't want to talk about it. And if we are talking, I don't want to tell you about the conversation. It's too early. But I do believe we're making progress. We want to stop the Ukraine-Russia war, and I want to stop it just because I hate to see all these young people being killed. The soldiers are being killed by the hundreds of thousands.

Speaker 12 ( 09:30 ):

So you're starting to put together a plan for a peace formula or for some resolution?

Donald Trump ( 09:35 ):

We're talking to both sides. Yeah.

Speaker 12 ( 09:37 ):

Okay. And then on Japan, are you okay with having a foreign country having a controlling interest in US Steel company?

Donald Trump ( 09:44 ):

Well, let's look at this. When I came here, they were going to buy it, and Biden was going to approve it. All of a sudden, Biden didn't because he heard I wasn't going to. I don't want US steel being owned by a foreign country-

Speaker 12 ( 09:57 ):

Controlling interest is okay?

Donald Trump ( 10:00 ):

They don't have a controlling… They have an investment. All they're going to have is an investment. I don't mind an investment in a company, but especially US Steel… US Steel, for 15 years, was the greatest company in the world, the greatest number-one company in the world. And I'm not going to let another country buy. We had a great meeting on that, but they are allowed to invest in it, and that's different.

Speaker 13 ( 10:24 ):

Mr. President, on tariffs, sir, you've talked about reciprocal tariffs coming in this week. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? And are you announcing a plan for it this week or will-

Donald Trump ( 10:35 ):

I'll be announcing probably Tuesday or Wednesday at a news conference, reciprocal tariffs. And very simply, it's if they charge us, we charge them. That's all.

Speaker 13 ( 10:45 ):

When is it going into effect, sir?

Donald Trump ( 10:46 ):

Almost immediately. But I'll be announcing the details of it, highly detailed, and it'll be great for everybody including the other countries. But if they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.

Speaker 13 ( 11:01 ):

Is this on every country?

Donald Trump ( 11:03 ):

Every country will be reciprocal.

Speaker 14 ( 11:06 ):

Mr. President, can you confirm that-

Donald Trump ( 11:07 ):

It won't affect everybody because there's somewhere, we have similar tariffs, but the ones that are taking advantage of the United States, we're going to have a… It's reciprocity. It's reciprocal. We're going to have a reciprocal tariff. But we'll have a news conference Tuesday or Wednesday.

Speaker 13 ( 11:22 ):

And just on the steel question, just so I understand it correctly-

Donald Trump ( 11:26 ):

We'll also be announcing steel tariffs on Monday.

Speaker 13 ( 11:29 ):

Tomorrow?

Donald Trump ( 11:30 ):

Monday. Yeah, tomorrow.

Speaker 13 ( 11:31 ):

What countries will those go on?

Donald Trump ( 11:33 ):

Everybody. Steel.

Speaker 13 ( 11:34 ):

Including Canada and Mexico-

Donald Trump ( 11:35 ):

Yeah, any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff.

Speaker 13 ( 11:41 ):

What about aluminum, sir?

Donald Trump ( 11:42 ):

Aluminum too.

Speaker 13 ( 11:45 ):

10% [inaudible 00:11:46]?

Donald Trump ( 11:45 ):

No, 25%.

Speaker 13 ( 11:45 ):

25 for aluminum-

Donald Trump ( 11:47 ):

25. For both.

Speaker 13 ( 11:49 ):

For both. And on steel, sir, are you ruling out then Nippon Steel having a 51% stake or higher, they won't have a majority stake?

Donald Trump ( 11:56 ):

Nobody can have a majority stake for US Steel. They can for other companies, but not for US Steel. I think you agree with that, Doug. Right? US Steel was one of our great companies. And through a lot of stupidity, and bad government, and also bad management of the company, it lost that luster. But it's going to gain it back, and tariffs are going to help. Tariffs are going to make it very successful again, and I think it is good management now. Yeah.

Speaker 14 ( 12:22 ):

Sorry, may I ask one, please? Can you confirm that you'll be meeting with MBS and Sisi of Egypt soon? Will that be at the White House or-

Donald Trump ( 12:31 ):

Well, I'll be meeting with all of them numerous times, by the way, but I'll be meeting with all of them. And, yeah, I think that it's a big mistake to allow people, the Palestinians or the people living in Gaza, to go back yet another time. And we don't want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site, and the United States is going to own it and we'll slowly, very slowly, we're in no rush, develop it. We're going to bring stability to the Middle East, to a totally war-torn part of the Middle East. And part of the Middle East has caused tremendous problem. Tremendous problem. The Gaza Strip. And we'll own it… It's totally demolished right now. It's a demolition site. It'll be reclaimed. It'll be leveled out, fixed up. There won't be anybody there. Hamas won't be there. We'll be building through other of the very rich countries in the Middle East. They'll be building some beautiful sites for the people, for the Palestinians to live in. They'll be living in harmony and peace probably for the first time in hundreds of years.

Speaker 14 ( 13:41 ):

And just to clarify, I know you don't want to tell us about your conversation with President Putin, but can you clarify whether you had that since you've been in office or whether it happened before you became president?

Donald Trump ( 13:52 ):

I've had it. Let's just say I've had it.

Speaker 14 ( 13:54 ):

As president-

Donald Trump ( 13:55 ):

And I expect to have many more conversations. We have to get that war ended. It's going to end. And we have to get it ended, and we have to get it ended soon. Should have never happened. Would've never happened if I was president.

Speaker 15 ( 14:07 ):

Mr. President, a couple of years ago, your vice president suggested that if the Supreme Court rules in a way you don't like, just let them enforce it. Do you agree with that?

Donald Trump ( 14:16 ):

Say the last part.

Speaker 15 ( 14:18 ):

The vice president suggested that if the Supreme Court rules in a way that you don't like, they can just enforce it by themselves. Do you agree with that?

Donald Trump ( 14:27 ):

I don't know even what you're talking about. Neither do you. Who are you with?

Speaker 15 ( 14:31 ):

HuffPost, sir.

Donald Trump ( 14:33 ):

Who?

Speaker 15 ( 14:33 ):

HuffPost.

Donald Trump ( 14:36 ):

No wonder. I thought they died. Are they still around? I haven't read them in years. I thought that died. All right, go ahead.

Speaker 15 ( 14:43 ):

On security clearance, as you've been yanking a lot of them, why does it make the country safer to take away the AG's security clearance and is that a form of retribution, which is-

Donald Trump ( 14:53 ):

If there's somebody now, if there are people that we don't respect, if there are people that we thought that were breaking the law, okay, very close to it in previous years, we do it. And we've done it with some people. We've done it with Biden himself. Biden himself. We think our country is not as safe if you gave him clearance, we don't think he knows what he's doing. And what he's done to this country is a disgrace. And what he's done in terms of allowing criminals, murderers, drug lords into our country, people from mental institutions into our country, he should be ashamed of himself.

Speaker 15 ( 15:29 ):

Is that a legally valid reason-

Speaker 16 ( 15:30 ):

On deportations, there's been some reporting that you've been upset that there haven't been more deportations. Can you clarify that?

Donald Trump ( 15:36 ):

I think they're doing an incredible job. It's very tough. Deportations, finding murderers is not easy. Some of them are actually very smart. They shouldn't be in our country. We had beautiful… We just set records for closure. We have the strongest border we've had in many years since my term, but maybe even for many, many years, decades before that. No, they're doing an amazing job. I think Tom Homan is doing an amazing job. Kristi Noem is doing an amazing job. But it's not easy finding murderers who know they're being looked for. But we're sending out thousands of people. We're getting rid of thousands of criminals from our country.

Speaker 17 ( 16:21 ):

[inaudible 00:16:22] you expect to meet him in person anytime-

Donald Trump ( 16:26 ):

Where?

Speaker 17 ( 16:27 ):

Putin, do you anticipate meeting with him in person?

Donald Trump ( 16:30 ):

I would imagine I would be meeting with Putin, yes, at the right time. I think at the right time, at the appropriate time.

Speaker 18 ( 16:37 ):

Mr. President, back on Gaza, the White House press secretary told us last week that you're committed to rebuilding Gaza. Steve Witkoff said that process would take 10 to 15 years. Does your commitment to rebuilding Gaza extend beyond your time in office?

Donald Trump ( 16:54 ):

I'm committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices, but we're committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn't move back. There's nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. The remainder will be demolished. Everything's demolished. I mean, you can't live in those buildings right now. They're very unsafe. But we'll make it into a very good site for future development by somebody. We'll let other countries develop parts of it. It'll be beautiful. People can come from all over the world and live there, but we're going to take care of the Palestinians. We're going to make sure they live beautifully, and in harmony, and in peace, and that they're not murdered. This has been the most dangerous site anywhere in the world to live in. Hamas has been a disaster.

( 17:54 ) And by the way, I have to tell you that I watched the hostages come back today and they looked like Holocaust survivors. They were in horrible condition. They were emaciated. It looked like many years ago, the Holocaust survivors. And I don't know how much longer we can take that, when I watch that. I know we have a deal where we're supposed to get, they dribble in and keep dribbling in, but they are in really bad shape. They have been treated brutally, horribly. Even the ones that came out earlier, they were in a little bit better shape, but, mentally, they were treated so badly. Who could take that? At some point, we're going to lose our patience. When I see that scene that I saw today with people coming out of helicopters and airplanes that are emaciated, that look like they haven't had a meal in a month, no reason for that. And I don't know how much longer we can take it.

Speaker 18 ( 18:59 ):

Do you mean you want to [inaudible 00:19:00] the hostages-

Donald Trump ( 19:01 ):

I don't know how long we can take it. When I watched people that were healthy people a reasonably short number of years ago, and you look at them today, they look like they've aged 25 years. They literally looked like the old pictures of Holocaust survivors. The same thing. I mean, the same thing. And I don't know how long we're going to take that.

Speaker 19 ( 19:27 ):

Mr. President, have you gotten some advancement in your proposals for some of the Gulf or Arab nations to take some of the Palestinian people? And if not, what do you think the reason is for their hesitance? Is there some very honest reason that they've even told you privately or that you think why they're hesitant to take the Palestinian people?

Donald Trump ( 19:47 ):

Why are they hesitant to take them? Because they never spoke to me. They spoke to other people, they didn't speak to me. When they speak to me, they're going to take them.

Speaker 19 ( 19:56 ):

Is it because they think that you would not allow them to return to Gaza? Is that part of it?

Donald Trump ( 20:01 ):

They don't want to return to Gaza. If we could give them a home in a safer area, the only reason they're talking about returning to Gaza is they don't have an alternative. When they have an alternative, they don't want to return to Gaza. If they had a home that was safe where you don't have Hamas threatening them, killing them, torturing them, they'd rather not return to Gaza. But right now, Gaza is the only alternative. As far as the other regions, the only reason they maybe don't act enthusiastic is they haven't talked to me. They talk to other people, but not to me. When they talk to me, they'll be enthusiastic.

Speaker 19 ( 20:37 ):

And then on spending, you found some maybe questionable expenditures or Elon Musk has found them-

Donald Trump ( 20:41 ):

Not some questionable. The whole country looks like it's a fraud. It's fraud, waste, abuse, but it's a tremendous fraud. And what Elon and his group of geniuses have found is unbelievable. It's unbelievable. And that's just in USAID. Soon, we're going into education. You'll find the same thing, but bigger. Soon, we're going into the military and you're going to find a lot of bad things happening there. You'll find it because our government has not functioned properly for many, many years, and we're going to make it function properly. We're even looking at treasuries. There could be a problem. You've been reading about that with treasuries, and that could be an interesting problem because it could be that a lot of those things don't count. In other words, that some of that stuff that we're finding is very fraudulent, therefore maybe we have less debt than we thought of. Think of that. So a lot of things are happening. But Elon's doing an excellent job. We started with 12 guys with high IQs and now we have 100 guys with very high IQs.

Speaker 20 ( 21:50 ):

Do you think Congress has failed to do their oversight or do you think your first administration, some of your cabinet agencies failed to-

Donald Trump ( 21:54 ):

I think everybody failed. I think everybody failed.

Speaker 21 ( 21:57 ):

Why does Elon's financial disclosure remain secret?

Donald Trump ( 22:02 ):

Because nobody's looking at that. We're looking at all the corruption that's taken place. I mean, his financial disclosure is largely the number of shares that he's got in very public companies, and that's not secret at all. If you read that, you'll see a lot. I mean, he talks about his whole thing. I read one where it really gave a very good history of him, but basically it's a number of shares times a certain stock price.

Speaker 21 ( 22:31 ):

So why is that not public?

Donald Trump ( 22:31 ):

It is public. All you have to do is read it.

Speaker 22 ( 22:31 ):

On USAID, sir, what is the message to countries that depend on humanitarian aid distributed through USAID? What is your message to those countries, sir?

Donald Trump ( 22:41 ):

The few that have been legitimate in terms of getting legitimate money will probably put it through the State Department. It'll be handled by Marco Rubio, a highly respected man, Secretary of State. There's no reason for USAID… When you look at the politicians that have been in there sucking the blood out of it, when you look at all of the fake deals… I mean, look, all you have to do is get a list of all of the things, you can see it by the heading. It's fake, it's fraudulent. It's probably kickbacks where they send the money, and then it gets kicked back to the person that sent it. So the ones that are good, and there are not many of them, but the ones that are good, and there are some, will probably have that be handled by Marco Rubio in the State Department.

Speaker 22 ( 23:28 ):

Will they take on some of the USAID workers or-

Donald Trump ( 23:32 ):

They could. They could if they like.

Speaker 23 ( 23:34 ):

Will it still be called USAID, Mr. President, or will it-

Donald Trump ( 23:37 ):

I don't know that it's going to exist. Why would you need it? The State Department can take care of it.

Speaker 23 ( 23:41 ):

Do you think the amount of spending on foreign aid will decrease also with just the number of [inaudible 00:23:46]?

Donald Trump ( 23:46 ):

It should decrease. Yeah. I hope it decreases.

Speaker 23 ( 23:48 ):

Yeah. By how much-

Donald Trump ( 23:50 ):

When we have $36 trillion in debt and we're taking care of countries that are very rich and sending aid to countries, in some cases, that are rich, in some cases, they're not rich, but, no, it should very much decrease.

Speaker 24 ( 24:04 ):

Mr. President, will the-

Donald Trump ( 24:05 ):

But it won't be the scams that you've seen.

Speaker 24 ( 24:10 ):

[inaudible 00:24:09] NIH put out a memo on Friday night. It's going to cut four billion from the percentage that they pay to universities, and public colleges, and all those things, not foreign countries. Four billion, is that okay to take off-

Donald Trump ( 24:21 ):

Sure. Sure. It could be okay. You have to look at the university. Some are legit. You could also say, "Why are we giving money to Harvard when it's got a $50 billion endowment, 50 billion, and yet they don't use that endowment to help their students?"

Speaker 24 ( 24:37 ):

This is for research like biomedical research [inaudible 00:24:40].

Donald Trump ( 24:39 ):

That's fine. Look, we want to take care of research. We want to do a lot of things. But when you look at the USAID and you look at all the things and all the scams that was, with… I don't have to go through it now, but I'll get you a list and you'll see, one after another, there were very few legitimate. It was the opposite. Usually, you find something wrong, 1 out of 100, but this is the opposite. Here, almost everything was wrong. You find very few that were good. But there were some that were good. That'll be handled by the State Department, I assume. That's not final yet, but I think the best would be Marco Rubio at the State Department. One or two more.

Speaker 25 ( 25:17 ):

[inaudible 00:25:17] spending too much on launch services? Is the Pentagon spending too much for launch services to space?

Donald Trump ( 25:25 ):

I think space is going to be a very important element. I'm the one that came up with Space Force. I'm very proud of it. Biden tried to get out of it and he was really rebuked by the military. I think space is going to be one of the most important things we do. It's going to be all about space, especially defense. So space is very important.

Speaker 26 ( 25:46 ):

Mr. President, would you accept Palestinian refugees into the United States since you're looking to other countries to accept-

Donald Trump ( 25:53 ):

I think it's a very far distance for them to travel, but I'd have to look at individual cases. But I do think that coming into the United States… We've taken a lot of people. But coming into the United States, it's a long way for them to travel. They're far away from their families, and their friends, and everything else. I think they'd be very happy staying in the general area, in a place that was safe, where they could be safe, and lead a good life. They don't want to go back to Gaza. As I said, I've said it a lot, they only go back because they have no alternative. They don't want to go back to Gaza. So we'll see. We hope that we'll be helped by Egypt, we hope that we'll be helped by Jordan, we hope that we'll be helped by other countries. We hope that some of the Saudi Arabia and others can spend some money on it. They have tremendous amounts of money and they'll spend some money on making people comfortable and safe.

Speaker 27 ( 26:49 ):

One question about the Super Bowl. You're going to the game. One of the big things that you've done so far in office is cracking down on DEI. I saw that the NFL commissioner said, I think this week, that they're happy with their diversity program. What's your take on that? Would you like to see any changes there?

Donald Trump ( 27:07 ):

I don't know what the diversity program is, to be honest. I know Roger very well. I'd have to look at what he said he's happy with. He was happy also with the flag and a lot of other things that didn't work out too well. We'll have to see what he was happy with. But right now, that's… You know what the law is. The law is the law, and it changed, and it's been backed up by the US Supreme Court. But we'll see. There are a lot of interesting things going on right now. I'll tell you what, there's a light over the United States. People are happy. They're more confident.

( 27:47 ) The approval ratings for this country have gone through the sky. More than at any time, we've had approval ratings that there's never been anything like it. We've never seen 49 points up… 49 points up. And I think there's a light actually long beyond this country, all over the world. I've been called by other leaders. They said, "Sir, there's a light over our country right now. There's a light over the world." We got rid of a horrible and totally inept administration. An administration where the president wouldn't even go and do a Super Bowl interview. For four years, he didn't do a Super Bowl interview. I did. You'll see it in about one or two hours.

Speaker 28 ( 28:34 ):

What is your analysis of the football game?

Speaker 29 ( 28:36 ):

[inaudible 00:28:36] opinion, sir, on whether the referees have been throwing the games to the Chiefs all season?

Donald Trump ( 28:40 ):

I don't believe that, and I don't [inaudible 00:28:41].

Speaker 29 ( 28:42 ):

Why do you want to be chairman-

Speaker 28 ( 28:42 ):

What is your analysis of the game? What are you [inaudible 00:28:42]?

Donald Trump ( 28:42 ):

Well, I think you're going to have a great game. It's two great teams. Who knows who's going to win. You have great players though. You have really superstars playing in both teams. So I think it's going to be a great game.

Speaker 29 ( 28:54 ):

Why do you want to be chairman of the Kennedy Center board?

Donald Trump ( 28:57 ):

Because I want to make sure it runs properly. We don't need woke at the Kennedy Center. We don't need… Some of the shows were terrible. They're a disgrace that they were even put on. So I'll be there until such time as it gets to be running right-

Speaker 29 ( 29:11 ):

Have you seen any shows there? How do you know they're terrible?

Donald Trump ( 29:13 ):

I didn't go. No. I got reports. It was so bad I didn't want to… I didn't want to go. There was nothing I wanted to see. Thank you very much, everybody.

Speaker 30 ( 29:20 ):

Donald Trump ( 29:21 ):

I look forward [inaudible 00:29:24].
