President Trump ( 00:00 ):

… [inaudible 00:00:00]. Just returning the favor with unbelievable splendor and warmth and I'm honored to be the first American president ever to officially visit your great country. It's a great honor for me, especially since I've known the incredible gentleman on my left for a long time, a lot longer than I've been in politics.

( 00:19 ) I knew him then, and I said, "This guy's going to make it someday." And I guess I was right, but I've known him a long time, he's been my friend for a long time. It's a real honor. I didn't know that I was going to be president, and I didn't know how successful he would be and what he's done with this incredible piece of land, beautiful piece of land. What he's done is incredible, I'm thinking.

( 00:44 ) So we will both have a much different position long ago, then it's been a lot of fun for me to see him rise. I also thank many other majority government leaders who have joined us and let me say to my Chief of Staff, a very, very special person. She is considered to be the most powerful woman on Earth, I can believe. You know and we know that anyway. The most powerful woman, but she's really one of the greatest people you'll ever meet.

( 00:58 ) Susie Wiles, I want to say happy birthday to you Susie, happy birthday. She was the first connection. As I said in my address to the region last night, in Saudi Arabia, the transformation that has taken place here in the Gulf with Gulf nations has been extraordinary method, less than extraordinary.

( 00:58 ) As Qatar's developed, it has been among the greatest of them all. Nobody's seen anything like it. Your country now stands as a hub of global commerce, acts as a key diplomatic force of the world stage, and has even hosted the World Cup. People said, "Oh, the World Cup is going," and by the way, Johnny's here someplace, where's Johnny?

Johnny ( 02:06 ):

[inaudible 00:02:06].

President Trump ( 02:06 ):

Congratulations Johnny, because you're going to be with us for the next [inaudible 00:02:13]. He's coming in the United States, actually. Thank you, great job to you, Johnny. The emir is building a sudden legacy of economic progress, engineering marvels. What I've seen is incredible. And cultural attainment that should make this entire nation so very, very proud. They are proud. [inaudible 00:02:36] who's so proud.

( 02:38 ) You only have to look at the shimmering skyline of Doha, or the beautiful waterfront promenade which I just looked at a little while ago. There wasn't a tree out of place. It was incredible to understand [inaudible 00:02:54] path to modernization and prosperity. And you've done it all while honoring your heritage.

( 02:52 ) You've always stayed with your heritage. You haven't given it up, maintained your culture, embracing your national traditions. To the emir, to the royal family, and to this entire nation, congratulations on a spectacular job. Well done. Congratulations, really something. As you can see from the extraordinary range of leaders and pioneers of this room, the biggest people on Earth. The most successful people, the most people.

( 03:19 ) Everyone wants to come and witness what is happening right here as President [inaudible 00:03:41] that our growing friendship is blossoming into a full-fledged economic and security partnership. As we've seen clearly on this trip, because we're setting records on this trip. We're bringing a lot of investment back into the United States of America is coming back at levels never seen before. Never seen anything like it.

( 03:52 ) In two months, we've done more than anybody. I don't know, is there anything? I don't think there's ever been this new growth-

Speaker 3 ( 03:52 ):

[inaudible 00:03:53].

President Trump ( 03:53 ):

… and that leads into any country. In addition to our agreement that we'll lead you with the $1.2 trillion in economic activity before we even start about the big Boeing deal and oil deal, any of those that we talked about today, we're pleased to supply your military with billions and billions of dollars in brand new equipment, and we're going to get a glimpse of some of it tomorrow morning at your military base which is incredible, by the way.

( 04:32 ) Earlier today we were honored by the escort of eight F-15s from your Air Force. And I want to say that I asked the pilot of Air Force One, "Do we need them?" And in [inaudible 00:04:52] he said, "Well, I'd rather have that," and that wasn't really the answer that I was looking for. "Do you understand?" So he said, "No, Your Honor, this is just fun, this is just fun. This is just fun and games." He didn't say that. But here we are, but they are something. We're looking at the window everywhere is amazing.

( 05:07 ) It's a little disconcerting when you see a plane that goes 2,000 miles an hour, when actually going 500 miles an hour is a strain for the plane, but you look at, and you can read the pilot's name on his helmet. And it's pretty close. But they were great pilots too.

( 05:30 ) Understanding that you have chosen the mighty Falcon as a symbol of your nation representing dignity and strength, that's what the Falcon represents. Our Qatari partner showed that spirit last weekend when he helped negotiate the release over the last living American hostage in Gaza, Edan Alexander. Hopefully this is a stepping stone for getting the rest of the hostages back.

( 06:18 ) I thought it was something. And you really did help us a lot, Steve Witkoff and Marco Rubio here. I want to thank you Steve, Marco, Scott, Howell, everybody was involved. Put a lot of hostages back, they've all been involved. You're also working with us very closely with respect to negotiating a deal with Iran, which is the far friendlier course than you would see.

( 06:24 ) Two courses, just knowing two courses, there are three, or four, or five. There's two. There's a friendly and a non-friendly, and non-friendly is a violent course, and I don't want that. I'll say it open, I don't want that to have to get moving. I hope the Iranian leaders understand that what you're doing, really what you're doing for them is a big favor.

( 06:45 ) Your prime minister, your great leader, right here on my left has been helping so much. And they respect them, and they listen to them, but they have to get moving within a week, both of them understand that. They have to make that decision, it's their decision.

( 07:04 ) Because we want to see all of them do well, thrive, be successful, and everybody be happy. I know many Iranians, I know many Iranians living in New York and Washington, D.C., they're great people. And we want to have this end peacefully, not horribly. So I just want to thank Your Highness for that act of help.

( 07:28 ) We're really helping the region, we're helping the world, we're helping, retrenching. Then we'll try to get it done, if we can, we're going to try and get it done. They have to move quickly, and I just hope Iran realizes what a good friend they have right here. And in a certain sense I guess I'm a good friend, but there's a lot of people who'd rather have me take a much more harsh road. But I know that if we can avoid that road, that would be a great thing.

( 07:53 ) I'd like to do that. This is an exciting time in America, as you know, it's really exciting. As you're hearing and seeing after years of recruiting shortfalls into the military enlistment has now reached the highest point in probably history, but definitely 30 years including for police and firefighters. But our military, we have the highest recruitment we've ever had. And just about a year ago you read headlines of people who aren't joining the military.

( 08:24 ) We had a lot of empty spaces that we had to fill in the morning that developed. And it's a pretty great thing with just in a short period of time, just a little short period of time we went from not having people wanting to serve in our military, Army, Air Force. Just that in the Army and the Air Force in particular, I don't know what was going on.

( 08:54 ) Navy, Marines, how about Space Force, Coast Guard? All great, but we couldn't get them. And now we have waiting lists to get in. So something happened. And I'll you what happened. We started November 5th where I won on behalf of everyone, I won on behalf of the people with common sense, the people that want to have a great country. The people with strength and intelligence.

( 09:13 ) I won all seven swing states, the popular vote by millions and millions of votes, the Electoral College, 312 to 246. Remember there was a, "Well, he might get to 270." Well, we got to 270, but we got to 312 actually and we had a great day and great evening. But very importantly, we learned the counties throughout the United States, 2,660 to 451.

( 09:44 ) That's why when you see the maps, they're all bright red. Red meaning Republican. So that was really something, there's a spirit going on in our country that we haven't seen in many, many years. But from that moment on our country's taken in commitments. We think it's probably that Scott is here, and Howard's here, Commerce. The Secretary of Treasury, Scott, has been great. Howard's been great.

( 09:50 ) But I think these numbers may be making them look better than they're supposed to be looking. Where are they? Howard, where are you in this? Howard, stand up, Howard. Now where's Scott? Where is he? Hello, Howard. You're not too far away. He's become a big story, you know every time he goes on television, everything goes up.

( 10:14 ) And sometimes they say it more forcefully, but he shouldn't do what I'm telling him. Because every time he does, he's really been considered one of the great gurus, one of the great geniuses of markets and understanding markets. And he does understand the market, and he also understands that we took on a terrible situation that was left to us by a prior administration.

( 10:49 ) And within a short period of time, I think we're in great shape. I think we're one of the most, maybe the most talked about. We're not the most talked about country anywhere in the world, but really… And this is in a period, a short period of time. What's the story? Literally 100 days, or more than three months, and let's say the first month doesn't count because for the first months, I wanted to fix up the oval office, make it look really nice.

( 11:10 ) So, just in a couple of short months we've taken in numbers that nobody ever thought possible. I don't think there's ever been anything like it in any country. And certainly there hasn't been in ours. So we'll be well over $10 trillion, and I want to thank Your Highness, for helping with that number. It's a big contribution. But you know you can count on us, and you know that it's going to be a great investment for you. It's been a great investment over the years.

( 11:45 ) So tonight, let us give thanks for the lessons of this friendship. We have a great friendship, our country and your country, added to by our friendship. And in keeping with the title of your national anthem, I want to wish peace to the emir and to all Qataris working together, we can help the entire region unlock its potential. You have unbelievable potential here, such great and such rich lands, such beautiful, magnificent. It's just a magnificent place.

( 12:20 ) And you're unlocking its potential. You have been a truly great leader in royal family. You have a great leader. Because you can have great land, you can have great wealth, you can have oil all over the place, you can have the oil and gas land nobody has. If you don't have a good leader, it doesn't mean a thing.

( 12:35 ) And you see it all the time, there are a lot of places with oil, there are a lot of places that you're supposed to have for success, and they're not successful. But you're successful because of a man who's sitting on my left is a special man. So I just wanted to say, it's an honor to be with you tonight, and I look forward to coming back and watching some more buildings go up, and everything else that you're doing here at a level that few people can even think about.

( 13:04 ) And I hope that you can help me with the Iran situation, because it's a perilous situation, and we want to do the right thing. We want to do something that's going to save maybe millions of lives. Because things like that get started, and they get out of control. I've seen it over and over and over again.

( 13:17 ) They go to war, and things get out of control. And we're not going to let that happen. So, I want to thank you and your prime minister and everybody else for the help you've given us. And in turn, we'll do things for you that I think you'll be very, very happy about. And that's more important than anything else, leading a great and safe and prosperous life in a fantastic country.

( 13:45 ) Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it, thank you.

Mohamed Suedi ( 15:44 ):

And now, please rise for [inaudible 00:13:56].

( 15:44 ) Thank you. Mr. President, Your Highness, Sheik Tamim, Your Highness, Sheik [inaudible 00:15:42] distinguishments. My name is Mohamed Suedi, and it is my honor to be your host for this evening.
