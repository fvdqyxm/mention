Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

… pull them all back, we'll get everybody in, right John?

John ( 00:02 ):

You heard that, didn't you?

Donald Trump ( 00:07 ):

But we really did… We have a lot of great people, and a lot of really fantastic people, and they're doing a tremendous job.

( 00:14 ) You stayed in session for a marathon 10 consecutive weeks, and that's the longest of any Senate in 15 years, and you held over 400 votes, more than any Senate in 35 years, and they were successful votes. And just a few weeks ago, we had the biggest victory of them all when you passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, and I just signed it into law, and I call it the Great Big Beautiful Bill, but I got overridden by a couple of my people. They said, "Let's call it the One Big," but it is really the Great Big. And we delivered the largest tax cut in American history, the largest spending cut in American history, the most deregulation in American history, and the largest border security investment in American history, and the biggest success on the border in American history.

( 01:05 ) As you know, last month, and we went from millions of people coming in, we had zero illegals coming into our country and we're trying to get our country straightened out, and you can't do that if they're going to come in by the tens of thousands. We had zero. Now, I'm not even sure I can believe zero, but it was a very liberal group, as you know, that keeps that tabulation, and they gave us a zero, so I think we'll take it, but it certainly wasn't very many.

( 01:38 ) And the One Big Beautiful Bill delivered on more Republican promises than any single piece of legislation that's ever been voted on before. And I want to thank Senate majority leader John Thune. Again, John, what you did is amazing, record setting, and you're a good man too. You're a very good man. He really is. Majority whip John Barrasso. John, thank you. What a man, what a guy. We got along from day one, right? He knew more about the medical stuff, and I said, "What do you think about this, that?" You did a fantastic job, and for a long time. Republican policy committee chair Shelley Moore Capito. Shelly, thank you. Thank you. Thank you Shelly. Senate finance committee chairman Mike Crapo. Good job. You know your stuff. I was calling, I was asking him some very tough questions on taxes. You always had the answer, some of which I didn't like, but that was okay. But you always had it. You know your business. Thank you, Mike. Great job.

( 02:56 ) Senate budget committee chairman, a gentleman named Lindsey Graham, just took a big lead in the polls. You're leading big. That's pretty good. Lindsey Graham. And all of you. I mean, just everyone in this room is special. You're all friends and you've just been incredible people. Because again, getting all of these votes with… Well, you can't lose two, and we had a couple, you can't lose two. And we actually had it where we were down much closer than this, and we said, "We're a heart attack away from losing the Senate. We were just hoping everybody's going to stay good and [inaudible 00:03:37] right John?

John ( 03:37 ):

That's right.

Donald Trump ( 03:39 ):

But we had some pretty close moments. But I don't think anybody's ever come close to doing this with a pretty tight majority, to put it nicely. So now we have three. And I think we have a chance in the midterms. I don't understand why they say that when you win the presidency, you always almost automatically lose the midterms, because nobody's had a more successful period of time than we have. So based on that, we should do great, and we'll see. But nobody's done more than we have as a group. It's not me, it's all of us together. And I'd like to thank Vice President JD vance, who's here someplace. Thank you, thank you. And he's been so terrific, JD, and we appreciate it, and you helped us a lot during those late evenings over the last three nights, and you really have been tremendous.

( 04:30 ) And Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This man is traveling all over the place. He's always traveling. He's going to different countries. He loves it. He's a natural. He's a natural. There's never going to be anybody better than the job you're doing right now. We appreciate it. We have some big things coming up [inaudible 00:04:47] Marco, we have some big things coming up right? Some big things and some very positive things, and thank you very much. You're doing a fantastic job. Who would have thought we fought like… He was so tough. Ted, he was tough on that debate stand, right? And you were very tough on the debate stand too. You guys were brutal. Who would think they're my friends? And now they're my friends. Well, they said it about Lincoln, he brought in all his enemies. Well, I don't know. They were sort of enemies, but they were very talented people, I want to tell you that.

( 05:23 ) Director Russ Vought is here. And thank you very much, Russ. Where are you? Thank you. Great job. And all of the wonderful spouses. The most important people here are the spouses, because without the spouses, it wouldn't work. We want to thank you, and also for the time, because as your wives and husbands, they were very busy getting home at four o'clock. I can vouch for every single one of them getting home at four o'clock, five o'clock, six o'clock in the morning. And you're saying, "Darling, were you really in Congress? Were you really sitting in your nice Senate seat?" I don't know. But no, they worked long and hard. And you know what? They laughed. They never complained. They never complained once. Very few of them went back. They'd just sit late into the night while we got this final vote. It's pretty amazing.

( 06:24 ) In 2024 together, we won a mandate from the American people. We won every single swing state and the electoral college, 312 to 226. And that was a big… Remember they said, "There is a path to 70." You have to have 70, 270, and "There's a path to 270," and yeah, the path was 312. I remember I went to Nebraska to get a half, to get a single vote, and I went there and it turned out we didn't need it. There was a certain circumstance under which that would have been a very important vote, and they were great in Nebraska, but we didn't need it. So we got 312. We won the popular vote by millions of votes, so we won counties throughout America 2,750 to 525. Think of that. 2,750 to 525. That's called a landslide.

( 07:21 ) The One Big Beautiful Bill delivered on that mandate, and we've fulfilled so many of our promises. In fact, somebody said today, a person that's not particularly good for us said, that we actually fulfilled more promises than we promised, which is a pretty nice statement. You don't hear that very often, but it's true, by a lot actually. And that's just the beginning. In January, we passed Senator Katie Britt's Laken Riley Act. Where's Katie? Katie. And a few months ago we passed Senator Ted Cruz's… And this was done with a very fantastic woman named Melania, right? You worked together, First Lady, and you passed the Take It Down Act, something that was very important, that actually had very good bipartisan support, almost unanimous support. A couple of people… I won't tell you their names, but a couple of people. But that was incredible. So that was with Ted Cruz and Melania. We appreciate it, Ted. That was a great job.

( 08:26 ) And just this week we passed the Rescissions Act of 2025, slashing nearly $10 billion of waste, and I guess I could say some fraud and some abuse, but at least we can say waste. Almost $10 billion, and we have numerous other rescissions coming up, adding many more $10 billion to it, so we're saving a lot of money. And on Wednesday I signed the Halt Fentanyl Act, and earlier today I signed Senator Bill Hagerty's GENIUS Act, and he named it after me and I was really… Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Bill. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, that's why I liked it very… I pushed very hard because of that, but to make America the crypto capital of the world, and that's what it's become. China wanted it, a lot of countries want it, but we are so far ahead, I think nobody's going to be able to come close anymore. So I want to thank you very much. Great job.

( 09:30 ) We also did something that… Public broadcasting, they've been looking to get it out of there for billions and billions of dollars, and very, very unfair, very, very unfair reporting. I would say they make CNN look honest, and we got rid of it finally. We got rid of it. We got rid of billions of dollars that was wasted on that. And Ronald Reagan tried, everybody tried. Everybody tried since Ronald Reagan and before, and John, we got it out. And I know it doesn't sound so nice when they hear, "That's terrible, public broadcast." It sounds so innocent. It's not innocent. It was brutal. It was brutal, very unfair. We achieved more in six months than almost any administration could accomplish in eight years, and we're going to have a lot of good six months left. We're going to have a six and another six and another six. So we'll keep going, and we're going to really do something.

( 10:27 ) Something I'm very proud of. We stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars would have been going on [inaudible 00:10:38] You had India-Pakistan. That was going, in fact planes were being shot out of the air. Five? Four or five, but I think five jets were shot down, actually, and Lindsey, that was getting worse and worse, wasn't it? That was looking like it was going to go… These are two serious nuclear countries, and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare. You saw it recently when you looked at what we did in Iran, where we knocked out their nuclear capability. Totally knocked out. It's going to be gone for a long time. But there seems to be a hit and then another hit, a hit and another hit. It's a different thing.

( 11:17 ) But India and Pakistan were going at it, and they were back and forth and it was getting bigger and bigger, and we got it solved through trade. We said, "You guys want to make a trade deal? We're not making a trade deal if you're going to be throwing around weapons." And maybe nuclear weapons. Both very powerful nuclear states. We did the Congo. This was going on for over 30 years, the Congo and Rwanda, and close to seven million people were really violently killed. This was a rough one, but going on over 30 years, and we had the various representatives here last week. The presidents will be coming to sign final documents, but we got that one solved.

( 12:02 ) Armenia and Azerbaijan, we worked magic there, and it's pretty close. If not, it's already done. And Gaza, we got most of the hostages back. We're going to have another 10 coming very shortly, and we hope to have that finished pretty quickly. And Steve Witkoff has been fantastic, he's done a great job in that. He's a very good man, good deal maker. I said, "I need a good deal maker with a good personality," and there aren't too many of them, but Steve is, and he's done a great job.

( 12:38 ) Serbia, Kosovo, they were going at it. They've gone at it for years, I guess for centuries, but they've gone at it for years, and we got that one taken care of. And Egypt and Ethiopia, as you know, they've been fighting over the dam. Ethiopia built a dam with United States money, largely. It's one of the largest dams in the world, and it has one little problem. It doesn't allow much water going into the Nile River, so you can imagine Egypt's not thrilled, because they live off the Nile River. The Nile River, it's blood, it's heart, it's everything. And we think we have that one pretty well taken care of.

( 13:15 ) But that was a pretty bad thing. I was watching this as it was going up. I get pictures and satellites and everything, and I'm looking at this massive dam and I'm saying, "Is that going to be blocking the water to the Nile?" And anyway, that should have never happened the way it happened, but financed by the United States of America. The whole thing is a little crazy, but we got that solved. I think that's going to be solved pretty long term.

( 13:42 ) Over the next year and a half, we'll have an incredible record to share with the American people. As long as we continue to keep our promises to the voters, Americans will continue to stand by our side, and in 2026, the Republican majority, I think, is going to be stronger in both the House and the Senate, and I really think it's going to be potentially much stronger. Look, nobody has done what people have done, I think ever, I can say, just about ever in the Senate, and we did it all in six months. I think Sunday night is actually six months.

( 14:15 ) So I really congratulate the people in this room. It's incredible. And I did a good job, but I couldn't have done it without you. I couldn't have done it without great leadership. And it's really terrific, and I appreciate it very much. And I guess we have a very, very simple phrase that we've gone by. Make America great again. You know, it's as simple as it can be, and I remember our opponent Biden saying, "We will stop 'America great again.'" I said, "You want to make America great again, Joe?" He said, "We will stop MAGA. We will stop MAGA." I said, "No no, MAGA's a good thing. It's 'Make America great again.'"

( 14:56 ) But the election we had was unbelievable. The result was pretty… They say one of great elections in a hundred and twenty-nine years, they're talking about. I said, "Well, I don't know where the hundred and twenty-nine years goes, but we'll take it." But I just want to thank you, because without your help, we could not have done what we've done or even come close. So great job to John and everybody, we appreciate it very much, and we're going to have a good meal tonight. I said, give us the A meal, not the B or the C. And it's really a celebration of great political people, great political minds, and wonderful men and women. Thank you all very much. [inaudible 00:15:39] Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

Speaker 3 ( 15:39 ):
