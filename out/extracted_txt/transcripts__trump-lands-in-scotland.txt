Donald Trump ( 00:58 ):

Hello everybody. You know our ambassador to Scotland and it's great to be in Scotland. We are going to be meeting with the prime minister, I guess tomorrow, a little bit tomorrow and the next day, and we're going to do some great things. Do you have any questions?

Reporters ( 01:18 ):

[inaudible 00:01:18] Ursula von der Leyen at the EU?

Donald Trump ( 01:18 ):

What?

Reporters ( 01:18 ):

Will you be meeting with Ursula von der Leyen?

Donald Trump ( 01:27 ):

Yes. I'll be meeting with the EU on Sunday and we'll be working on a deal. We'll see if we make a deal. Ursula will be here. Highly respected woman, so we look forward to that. That'll be good.

Reporters ( 01:43 ):

[inaudible 00:01:49]?

Donald Trump ( 01:48 ):

We'll have numerous executives that we're meeting with. A lot. We're going to be meeting with a lot of people. A lot of people will be staying at Turnberry and then we're going to Aberdeen, which is the oil capital of Europe actually.

Reporters ( 02:01 ):

Mr. President, can you explain what is missing in the UK deal that you have to work out?

Donald Trump ( 02:07 ):

Nothing, we just, I think it's more of a celebration than a work out. It's a great deal for both and we're going to have a meeting on other things other than the deal. The deal is concluded.

Reporters ( 02:29 ):

[inaudible 00:02:26] the French President Emmanuel Macron said [inaudible 00:02:29] officially recognize the Palestinian state, what's your comment on that?

Donald Trump ( 02:31 ):

Well, that's what he does. I mean, that's fine if he does that, that's up to him. It's not up to me. I'm with the United States, I'm not with France.

Reporters ( 02:41 ):

And the humanitarian situation in Gaza, we hear very dire warnings about things-

Donald Trump ( 02:46 ):

I think it's terrible what happened with Hamas. They tapped everybody along and we'll see what happens. We'll see what response Israel has to that, but it's getting to be that time.

Reporters ( 03:00 ):

You said there's a 50/50 chance of a deal. What is left to work out? What are the final sticking points?

Donald Trump ( 03:07 ):

I don't know. With the European Union, I think we have a good 50/50 chance. That's a lot.

Reporters ( 03:13 ):

What are the sticking points that you said-

Donald Trump ( 03:15 ):

Well, I don't want to tell you what the sticking points are, but the sticking points are having to do with maybe 20 different things. You don't want to listen to all of them. Yes?

Reporters ( 03:28 ):

What advice are you going to have for our prime minister about free speech? It's very important to people here.

Donald Trump ( 03:28 ):

Well, it is, but I like your prime minister. He's slightly more liberal than I am, as you've probably heard, but he's a good man. He got a trade deal done and they've been working on this deal for 12 years. He got it done. It's a good deal. It's a good deal for the UK.

( 03:44 ) So no, I'll be seeing him tomorrow, I guess, tomorrow evening. And this is our wonderful ambassador as you know, he's doing a good job. He's a very, very successful man. He'll be doing a good job.

Reporters ( 03:59 ):

The Royal and Ancient says you're going to have to improve infrastructure at Turnberry to bring the Open back. Is that something you [inaudible 00:04:07]-

Donald Trump ( 04:08 ):

I don't know. The best course, the best course anywhere in the world is Turnberry. The players all want to be at Turnberry. Everybody wants to be at Turnberry, so we'll see how that works out.

Reporters ( 04:17 ):

The infrastructure needs to be improved massively.

Donald Trump ( 04:18 ):

I think, well, infrastructure and the course is good. In fact, the Royal and Ancient, I don't know if you're aware of this, they spent a lot of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars or probably into the millions of dollars.

( 04:34 ) And they've laid all the wire for television and for electricity under the holes of Turnberry so that when the Open gets there, they have it all done. They paid for that.

Reporters ( 04:44 ):

But we're talking about roads to railway stations. That's something-

Donald Trump ( 04:48 ):

Well, I don't know. See, I don't know what you can do. All I can tell you is that it would be the best place anywhere in your country to have… There's no place like it. There's no place like Turnberry. It's the best, probably the best course in the world. And I would say Aberdeen is right up there also. Aberdeen is great.

( 05:05 ) And while we're here, I'll be with my son and he's going to cut a ribbon for the second course at Aberdeen, which is just about equal to the first. I mean, it's going to be a battle to, it's as you know, they're very highly rated, and the second course is great.

( 05:21 ) Sean Connery helped get me the permits. If it weren't for Sean Connery, we wouldn't have those great courses.

Reporters ( 05:34 ):

Mr. President were you briefed on your name appearing in the Epstein files ever?

Donald Trump ( 05:35 ):

No. I was never briefed, no.

Reporters ( 05:35 ):

Did you ask how-,

( 05:36 ) What are you hoping Todd Blanche interviewing Ghilaine Maxwell, what are you you hoping that they get out of that?

Donald Trump ( 05:42 ):

I really have no, really nothing to say about it. She is being talked to by a very smart man, by a very good man, Todd Blanche. And I don't know anything about the conversation. I haven't really been following it.

( 05:59 ) A lot of people are asking me about pardons. Obviously this is no time to be talking about pardons, but a lot of people have asked about pardons. This is just not a time to be talking about pardons. Todd will come back with whatever he's got.

( 06:14 ) You make it a very big thing over something that's not a big thing. You should be talking about, if you're going to talk about that, talk about Clinton, talk about the former president of Harvard. Talk about all of his friends. Talk about the hedge fund guys that were with him all the time. Don't talk about Trump.

( 06:32 ) What you should be talking about is the fact that we have the greatest six months in the history of a presidency according to a lot of people. And we had an amazing six months, and this is an example of it. Now we're meeting with the European Union, we're also meeting with, as you know, the head of UK, prime minister and I look forward to that.

( 06:57 ) But we're meeting, in terms of a deal we're meeting with the European Union and that would be actually the biggest deal of them all if we make it.

Reporters ( 07:05 ):

Did you ask House Republican leaders to not vote on the resolution about raising [inaudible 00:07:11]-

Donald Trump ( 07:10 ):

No, I was never involved in that. I'm focused on making deals. I'm not focused on conspiracy theories that you are. I mean, I watch you people, it's so sad. You ought to talk about the success of our country instead of this nonsense you can talk about over and over again.

Reporters ( 07:27 ):

You've done an amazing job on illegal migration in America.

Donald Trump ( 07:30 ):

I have.

Reporters ( 07:31 ):

People here are very worried about the situation, record numbers.

Donald Trump ( 07:35 ):

Well, I say two things to Europe. Stop the windmills. You're ruining your countries. I really mean it. It's so sad. You fly over and you see these windmills all over the place ruining your beautiful fields and valleys and killing your birds. And if they're stuck in the ocean ruining your oceans. Stop the windmills.

( 07:57 ) And I also, I mean there's a couple of things I could say, but on immigration, you better get your act together. You're not going to have Europe anymore. You got to get your act together. And we, as you know, last month we had nobody entering our country, nobody. Shut it down.

( 08:14 ) And we took out a lot of bad people that got there with Biden. Biden was a total stiff and what he allowed to happen. But you're allowing it to happen to your countries and you got to stop this horrible invasion that's happening to Europe, many countries in Europe.

( 08:30 ) Some people, some leaders have not let it happen and they're not getting the proper credit they should. I could name them to you right now, but I'm not going to embarrass the other ones. But stop. This immigration is killing Europe. And the other thing, stop the windmills killing the beauty of your countries. Thank you very much everybody.
