President Trump ( 00:03 ):

Hello, everybody. I hope you had a good time in beautiful Scotland. Did a lot of work with the European Union and yesterday I spent pretty much a whole day with the Prime Minister of UK and we had a lot of good discussions. Although I see something came up today, which is interesting.

( 00:24 ) So, go ahead. Hello.

Speaker 1 ( 00:26 ):

Hi, Mr. President. [inaudible 00:00:27]-

Speaker 2 ( 00:27 ):

Can we ask about that [inaudible 00:00:29] on Gaza? Keir Starmer has just announced the UK will recognize Palestinian sovereignty in September, if Israel does not commit to a ceasefire, ease the suffering in Gaza, and commit to a long-term solution that would deliver the two-state solution in the Middle East. Did you know that was coming? What did you discuss?

President Trump ( 00:45 ):

No, we never discussed it, surprisingly, it was never really discussed. Maybe a little bit at the news conference, but he was discussing it with you. We never did discuss it and we have no view on that. We're going to get a lot of money to the area so they can get some food. He's going to also, I think the European Union is going to put up money too for food and hopefully it's going to be properly distributed, and it will be, I think it will be. We have some pretty good response on people for the distribution of the food.

Speaker 1 ( 01:17 ):

Mr. President.

President Trump ( 01:18 ):

We want to take it one thing at a time. They need food and they need people to be able to get them the food.

Speaker 2 ( 01:25 ):

But to follow up on that, is there any use at all in pressuring Israel now to come to some sort of longer-term solution? [inaudible 00:01:32]-

President Trump ( 01:32 ):

Well, you could make the case that you're rewarding people, that you're rewarding Hamas if you do that. And I don't think they should be rewarded, so I'm not in that camp to be honest. We'll let you know where we are in, but I am not in that camp.

Speaker 1 ( 01:47 ):

Mr. President.

President Trump ( 01:48 ):

Because if you do that, you really are rewarding Hamas and I'm not about to do that.

Speaker 1 ( 01:52 ):

Mr. President, you mentioned setting up food centers. When can we expect to see those food centers?

President Trump ( 01:58 ):

Very soon. Very soon. So we said $60 million. It's a lot of money for food, a lot of money, that can take care of people for a long time. And we want to make sure it's being spent properly and part of the spending is the distribution. If you know, a lot of money's been sent by other countries, but nothing compared to us, but a lot of things have been stolen. They send money, they send food and Hamas steals it, so it's a tricky little game, but we're going to make sure we have some very good people. They're going to be watching it.

Speaker 1 ( 02:32 ):

Who is going to be running those food centers for you and what kind of oversight can we expect?

President Trump ( 02:36 ):

Well, we're going to be dealing with Israel and we think they can do a good job of it. And they want to do it.

Speaker 1 ( 02:44 ):

Of monitoring the food centers?

President Trump ( 02:45 ):

No, they want to do it, the food centers. They want to preside over the food centers to make sure the distribution is proper.

Speaker 3 ( 02:51 ):

Mr. President, we all agree [inaudible 00:02:52] seeing that beautiful course, but there's some critics who say this was a promotional trip for you and your [inaudible 00:02:56]-

President Trump ( 02:56 ):

That it was what?

Speaker 3 ( 02:58 ):

That it promoted you and your business personally. What do you say to them?

President Trump ( 03:01 ):

I haven't heard that. No, I haven't heard that. Did you get to see my drive in the first hole?

Speaker 3 ( 03:06 ):

You hit it straight and pretty high.

President Trump ( 03:08 ):

I did. Pretty long. It's pretty long. That's no Joe Biden, let me tell you. That's not Biden, right? That was a good drive.

Speaker 4 ( 03:22 ):

When did you last speak to Prime Minister Netanyahu? And when will you speak to [inaudible 00:03:23].

President Trump ( 03:23 ):

Two days ago.

Speaker 4 ( 03:24 ):

How many?

President Trump ( 03:25 ):

Two days ago.

Speaker 4 ( 03:26 ):

Do you think you'll-

President Trump ( 03:27 ):

I said we sent money and I want to make sure the money is spent wisely, and it's spent judiciously, and that food is distributed in a proper manner. And he wants to do that.

Reporter ( 03:38 ):

Mr. President, you've talked about moving Palestinians out of Gaza and cement the past. Do you still support that idea?

President Trump ( 03:45 ):

Well, it's a concept that some people fell in love with it and some people don't. We really have to see how it all works out before we do that. But you could do something spectacular, but that's a different concept. Some are leaving automatically, you know that. Some would like to leave. I think many would like to leave if they were given an alternative, they really have no alternative now. But certainly that was a concept that was really embraced by a lot of people, but also some people didn't like him.

Reporter ( 04:17 ):

Prime Minister Starmer, he was critical of Israel and said more pressure needed to be put on Israel to allow food to get in at speed. Do you feel that Israel is a good-

President Trump ( 04:32 ):

I think Israel wants to do it actually. I think Israel wants to do that. They're going to want to, and I can tell you that they want to do it. They don't want Hamas stealing the money or stealing the food, and that's what they've been doing.

Reporter ( 04:46 ):

Do you think Israel can be trusted to allow more food in faster?

President Trump ( 04:49 ):

Look, I think Israel wants to do it, and they'll be good at doing it. If they do it, and if they really want to do it, and I think they do, they'll do a good job. The food will be properly distributed.

Speaker 4 ( 04:58 ):

There's a perception maybe that Keir Starmer didn't do so well in the press conference yesterday. Do you have any words of support for him?

President Trump ( 05:07 ):

I thought he did well in the press conference and I think they made a good deal. I think we all made a good deal. Why, are you hearing otherwise, I guess?

Speaker 4 ( 05:18 ):

Yeah.

President Trump ( 05:20 ):

You are.

Speaker 4 ( 05:20 ):

And I think the feeling is that he was maybe a little weak and didn't really have very strong answers and maybe wasn't entirely honest about free speech and immigration.

President Trump ( 05:28 ):

I don't know. I like him. I think he's good. I think he's a great representative for UK. I haven't heard that.

Speaker 5 ( 05:34 ):

In your meeting with John Swinney today, did you offer to drop tariffs on Scotch whisky?

President Trump ( 05:39 ):

No, we really didn't discuss it much, but I have a lot of respect for him.

Speaker 5 ( 05:44 ):

Mr. President-

President Trump ( 05:44 ):

And I didn't have a lot of respect for the woman that preceded him. I thought she was terrible as a first minister of Scotland. But I think John is doing a very good job as first minister.

Speaker 1 ( 05:54 ):

Mr. President, your treasury secretary and Howard Lutnick, secretary of commerce… China talks wrapped today. Any sort of reaction coming out of the meeting? They're extending the truce. Are you pleased with that? Would you like to concede?

President Trump ( 06:09 ):

I just had a phone call from Scott Bessent and had a very good meeting with China and it seems that… They're going to brief me tomorrow. We'll either approve it or not, but he felt very good about the meeting, better than he felt yesterday. Yesterday, I said, "Here we go again. Here we go again." But today it worked out very well.

Speaker 1 ( 06:32 ):

And I saw-

President Trump ( 06:34 ):

I think the result is probably pretty.

Speaker 1 ( 06:36 ):

I saw a report from Reuters that India is preparing to face higher U.S. tariffs between 20 and 25%. Is that what you're tracking or what do you think the rate will be for India?

President Trump ( 06:45 ):

That they are going to pay 25%?

Speaker 1 ( 06:47 ):

Yeah, the India's preparing to face higher U.S. tariffs between 20 and 25%.

President Trump ( 06:50 ):

Yeah, I think so. Look, India's been… They're my friends and he's my friend and the end of the war with Pakistan at my request, and it was great. And Pakistan did also. We did a lot of great settlements, including the recent one, as you know, with Cambodia, blah, blah, blah. So that was a great one. I think that's been pretty well finalized now, right?

Speaker 1 ( 07:16 ):

I don't know. I'm asking you.

President Trump ( 07:18 ):

Did I do a good job in that one? I did a good job in about five different wars. Do you think I'll get credit for it? No. Will I get credit for it? She'll say yes. No.

Speaker 1 ( 07:30 ):

Is the deal with India finalized?

President Trump ( 07:33 ):

No, it's not.

Speaker 1 ( 07:34 ):

Okay, so what rate are you expecting it to be?

President Trump ( 07:37 ):

Oh, we're going to see, we're going to see, but India's been a good friend. But India has charged basically more tariffs than almost any other country. You know that, right? Over the years. But now I'm in charge and you just can't do that. I think the trade deals are working out very well, hopefully for everybody. But for the United States, they're very, very good.

Reporter ( 07:58 ):

Mr. President, The Wall Street Journal case lawyers are seeking to depose Robert Murdoch. Rupert Murdoch, pardon me. Can you say what the lawyers hope to get out of that?

President Trump ( 08:07 ):

Oh, I don't know. We're going to see, it's in the lawyer's hands. I've been treated very unfairly by The Wall Street Journal and everything. I don't know. They even hired people from The Washington Post, third-rate reporters, gossip-type reporters. It's all gossip. And I've been treated badly by The Wall Street Journal. I would've assumed that Rupert Murdoch controls it, but maybe he does, maybe doesn't. They are talking to us about doing something, but we'll see what happens. Maybe they would like us to drop that and so we'll see.

Reporter ( 08:39 ):

Does that mean they're settling [inaudible 00:08:41]?

President Trump ( 08:41 ):

Yeah, they want to settle it.

Reporter ( 08:44 ):

With money involved?

President Trump ( 08:45 ):

No, he's treated us wrong. When I get treated unfairly, I do things about it, so we'll see what happens.

Speaker 5 ( 08:53 ):

On Gaza, last week, you were rather dismissive of President Macron when he recognised the Palestinian state. Today, you saying

President Trump ( 09:00 ):

No,

Reporters ( 09:00 ):

[inaudible 00:09:01]-

President Trump ( 09:00 ):

That's his opinion. He could have an opinion. It doesn't mean I have to agree. Emmanuel's a good man. He works hard. Got a lot to say about everything. [inaudible 00:09:09]-

Speaker 6 ( 09:09 ):

But now you're saying you're not taking a view on Sir Keir Starmer's announcement. Does that mean you [inaudible 00:09:15]?

President Trump ( 09:15 ):

No, I guess, Starmer's doing the same as Macron, right? He's, basically, is he's saying the same thing. I think so. Essentially, they're saying the same thing. And that's okay. But it doesn't mean I have to agree.

Speaker 7 ( 09:27 ):

Mr. President, you said yesterday your falling out with Jeffrey Epstein was over him taking some of the workers from your business, but your administration in the past said that you threw him out because he was a creep. So can you explain that discrepancy?

President Trump ( 09:39 ):

Well, maybe they're the same thing. It's sort of a little bit of the same thing. But, no, he took people that worked for me and I told him don't do it anymore and he did it and I said, "Stay the hell out of here."

Speaker 8 ( 09:54 ):

What did they do-

Speaker 7 ( 09:54 ):

[inaudible 00:09:55]-

Speaker 8 ( 09:54 ):

Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 7 ( 09:56 ):

So is that what was meant by [inaudible 00:09:59]-

President Trump ( 09:58 ):

Who are you with?

Speaker 7 ( 09:58 ):

Me?

President Trump ( 09:58 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 7 ( 09:58 ):

I'm the travel pool, but I'm with NBC News.

President Trump ( 10:00 ):

NBC? NBC fake news. Okay. NBC is one of the worst. What else do you have?

Speaker 8 ( 10:05 ):

I was on the new Air Force One. When do you expect to be flying on the new Air Force One?

President Trump ( 10:11 ):

I think by, let's say, February, maybe.

Speaker 8 ( 10:14 ):

Maybe [inaudible 00:10:15]-

President Trump ( 10:14 ):

Much sooner than the others. The others are being built. Long time build. That's a long time build. Now they're not normal 747s. They have a lot of things on them that another plane wouldn't have, but we'll get this one a year-and-a-half, two years earlier.

Speaker 8 ( 10:31 ):

How much will it cost to retrofit it?

President Trump ( 10:33 ):

I don't know. That's up to the military. I don't know. I really don't know. I haven't been involved. It's their plane. It's the Air Force. They'll be spending an amount of money. It is a different plane because it becomes for military use. But I don't know what the number.

Speaker 8 ( 10:50 ):

There have be questions about whether the amount that it'll cost hundreds of millions of dollars, whether that's worth it considering how little time you'll be in [inaudible 00:10:57]-

President Trump ( 10:57 ):

Well, it's a great plane. It's one of the best planes in the world. The Air Force is going to have it. We're going to have a great 747. We need it. If you look at this plane, it's what? Is it 32, 34, 35? I don't know. It's old. It's a good plane, but it's old. Can't get parts for it anymore. It's very hard to get parts. They have to go and take from the older planes. So it was time.

( 11:26 ) When you look at 747s and the heads of state from, especially the Arab countries, you look at Saudi Arabia, from some of those countries, and you put it next to this, it doesn't show well for the United States. And if you remember, it was Obama that wanted to get the plane. He was the one ready to sign a contract. And because he wanted to sign it, I assumed they paid too much and I was able to get about a billion seven off the price. Maybe a billion five to a billion seven off the price for the exact same plane. And they're building it, but they're taking a lot longer than they should have taken.

Speaker 15 ( 12:04 ):

There's a report that a Secret Service agent tried to get his wife on [inaudible 00:12:09]-

President Trump ( 12:08 ):

I just heard that. That's a weird deal.

Speaker 15 ( 12:12 ):

Yeah. [inaudible 00:12:12]-

President Trump ( 12:12 ):

He was going to leave the wife in the car? Wouldn't you think that might be a little dangerous? I don't know if that has proper compression. I don't know. That's a strange one. I just heard that two minutes ago. I think Sean's taking care of it.

Speaker 8 ( 12:27 ):

Mr. President, you talked on [inaudible 00:12:29]-

President Trump ( 12:29 ):

Is that a serious story?

Speaker 15 ( 12:30 ):

I think it's [inaudible 00:12:32]-

President Trump ( 12:31 ):

They were going to keep her in the car and she's going to be in a freighter?

Speaker 15 ( 12:35 ):

Well, you tell me the details. [inaudible 00:12:37]-

President Trump ( 12:36 ):

Those freighters don't have, you know…

Speaker 15 ( 12:38 ):

He was going to keep her in the car? Tell us how it was going to work.

President Trump ( 12:44 ):

I don't want to get involved, but it's a strange story. I just heard that one.

Speaker 9 ( 12:45 ):

Mr. President.

Reporters ( 12:45 ):

[inaudible 00:12:46]-

Speaker 9 ( 12:46 ):

Mr. President. Mr. President, you said that you were going to set the new-

President Trump ( 12:53 ):

[inaudible 00:12:54]?

Speaker 10 ( 12:53 ):

The British farmers are so grateful for what you said yesterday about the importance of farming, because we have changed inheritance tax, death taxing.

President Trump ( 12:59 ):

Well, farmers are so important. Some farmers, they liked what I said on a couple of things yesterday. I'm a big farmer person. I love the farmers. I think they're great. And we have to steer the laws so the farmers don't get hurt in our country and in their country. But Europe has a big immigration problem. But they also liked when I said that they have one of the worst mayors anywhere in the world in London. He's a horrible mayor, nasty guy. Stupid guy, in my opinion. But he's a nasty man and I want nothing to do with him. But I didn't think it was a big statement and so many people said, "Thank you for saying that." He's a bad guy. Khan is his name, I guess? He's done a lousy job. I can tell you that.

Speaker 10 ( 13:45 ):

[inaudible 00:13:47]-

President Trump ( 13:46 ):

Terrible mayor.

Speaker 9 ( 13:47 ):

Mr. President.

Reporters ( 13:48 ):

[inaudible 00:13:48]-

Speaker 9 ( 13:48 ):

Mr. President.

President Trump ( 13:49 ):

But people liked it so much when I said that.

Speaker 9 ( 13:50 ):

Mr. President, yesterday you mentioned that you would change the Russia deadline to 10 to 12 days. Has that started yet? Or when can we see the official statement that that is the new deadline?

President Trump ( 14:03 ):

I'll tell you what. I'll give it to you now. Do you want a big scoop?

Speaker 9 ( 14:06 ):

Yes, please.

President Trump ( 14:06 ):

Everybody else close your ears. Okay? You ready?

Speaker 9 ( 14:09 ):

I'm ready.

President Trump ( 14:09 ):

10 days from today.

Speaker 9 ( 14:12 ):

Got it.

President Trump ( 14:12 ):

Okay?

Speaker 9 ( 14:12 ):

Got it.

President Trump ( 14:13 ):

Good.

Speaker 11 ( 14:13 ):

Have you communicated-

President Trump ( 14:14 ):

We have a scoop.

Speaker 9 ( 14:15 ):

Thank you.

President Trump ( 14:16 ):

And then we're going to put on tariffs and stuff. And I don't know if it's going to affect Russia because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going. But we're going to put on tariffs, the various things that you put on.

Speaker 11 ( 14:29 ):

[inaudible 00:14:30]-

Speaker 9 ( 14:29 ):

And-

President Trump ( 14:29 ):

It may or may not affect them, but it could.

Reporters ( 14:32 ):

Are you [inaudible 00:14:33]-

Speaker 11 ( 14:32 ):

Have you [inaudible 00:14:33]-

Speaker 12 ( 14:33 ):

Have you spoken to any of the families of the victims of the Manhattan shooting?

President Trump ( 14:37 ):

I don't want to tell you that. I don't want to tell you that.

Speaker 12 ( 14:40 ):

Have you spoken to Mayor Adams?

President Trump ( 14:42 ):

Boy, that's a bad one. That's a bad one. But I won't tell you about that.

Speaker 12 ( 14:46 ):

Have you talked to Mayor Adams? Have you spoken with Mayor Adams?

President Trump ( 14:47 ):

I have, yeah.

Speaker 12 ( 14:47 ):

Okay.

Speaker 6 ( 14:50 ):

One of the other things our readers liked from yesterday was when you were talking [inaudible 00:14:55] about illegal immigration in the United Kingdom.

President Trump ( 14:56 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 6 ( 14:57 ):

One of the big political flashpoints is migrant hotels, where people are being put up while their claims are processed. People see it as a source of security-

President Trump ( 15:04 ):

In beautiful luxury hotels.

Speaker 6 ( 15:07 ):

They also think there's low security and it's a problem for their communities. Is that appropriate or does Britain need an Alligator Alcatraz?

President Trump ( 15:14 ):

It's not an Alligator. It's just that they're putting people in luxury hotels and other people that are working their asses off are living from hand to mouth and not living the same way. I mean, I looked at some of the hotels they're using. And they've done it in our country also. They've put them in the best hotels anywhere in the world, because they could get rooms there. Thousands of dollars a night and other people are living out of the streets, including our veterans. They can't get a room. Our veterans are living on the streets. There are pictures of our veterans staying right by the door where they're walking in to live and the veterans are sitting out on the sidewalk in front of a fancy hotel and the illegals are coming in into that hotel and staying there for a week. It's no good.

Speaker 13 ( 16:03 ):

Just to button up on Mar-a-Lago, you're saying that Jeffrey Epstein poached two of your staffers? Who were they? Were they young-

President Trump ( 16:08 ):

Yeah, I don't want to say two or I don't want to say any number. You're talking about many years ago. But, yeah, he took people and because he took people I said, "Don't do it anymore. They work for me." Beyond that, he took some others. And once he did that, that was the end of him.

Speaker 13 ( 16:23 ):

And were they young women?

Reporters ( 16:24 ):

[inaudible 00:16:24]-

President Trump ( 16:25 ):

When they steal people, I don't like it.

Speaker 13 ( 16:26 ):

[inaudible 00:16:27]-

Speaker 10 ( 16:26 ):

Did anybody ever go to prison for a social media post?

President Trump ( 16:27 ):

Are you saying that that's taking place in the UK?

Speaker 10 ( 16:35 ):

Yeah. [inaudible 00:16:37]-

President Trump ( 16:35 ):

Is it really?

Speaker 10 ( 16:41 ):

Yeah.

President Trump ( 16:41 ):

I mean, I'm hearing that. Well, I looked at it yesterday. Well, they said they canceled truth social. I'll bet it's un-canceled very quickly.

Speaker 10 ( 16:46 ):

[inaudible 00:16:48]-

President Trump ( 16:47 ):

I'll bet it's [inaudible 00:16:48]-

Speaker 10 ( 16:48 ):

[inaudible 00:16:48] powers [inaudible 00:16:49]-

President Trump ( 16:50 ):

No, it's a little different. It's different. I see it in some countries that you would never suspect it. Not only there. I've seen it in other countries where they're like bread and pudding countries, I think, and then all of a sudden they become somewhat violent. When people go socialistic or when you get the radical left or the left going in, the countries actually become very mean. They become two things, mean and incompetently run, simultaneously.

( 17:19 ) How is Caroline doing? Is she doing a good job?

Reporters ( 17:21 ):

[inaudible 00:17:22].

President Trump ( 17:22 ):

Look at her. She's such a star.

( 17:23 ) Come on, Caroline. Come here.

Speaker 14 ( 17:26 ):

Chloe wanted to watch, sir.

President Trump ( 17:27 ):

Chloe, do you want to come over? Chloe, she's a great golfer, a great talented golfer. She's probably the most talented golfer, other than Kai, but I think it's about the same, right? Don't you think?

Reporters ( 17:39 ):

[inaudible 00:17:40]-

Chloe ( 17:40 ):

Yeah, [inaudible 00:17:41]-

President Trump ( 17:40 ):

She hits the ball long. This little girl has a lot of muscle, right?

Chloe ( 17:46 ):

Yeah.

President Trump ( 17:46 ):

So-

Speaker 10 ( 17:46 ):

Did you have a nice weekend?

President Trump ( 17:47 ):

And she wins every tournament she plays in of her age.

Speaker 10 ( 17:54 ):

Did you have a fun weekend? You had a fun weekend?

Chloe ( 17:55 ):

Yes, very fun.

President Trump ( 17:55 ):

You love golf, right?

Chloe ( 17:56 ):

Yes.

President Trump ( 17:56 ):

But she's a great athlete.

Speaker 6 ( 17:57 ):

How did the golf course play today?

President Trump ( 17:59 ):

Great.

Speaker 6 ( 17:59 ):

And be honest,

Reporter ( 18:00 ):

Did anyone in your foursome hit that massive bunker on the 9th?

President Trump ( 18:04 ):

That is a massive bunker. Fortunately, nobody did. Well. I played, two of the guys were pros and really good players. One of them won the tournament last year and you can see they were very good players.

Reporter ( 18:16 ):

Who at the moment holds the course record?

President Trump ( 18:19 ):

Well, we played a first round. Let's see, we only played one round. This was our first round, so I'd have to go into that exactly. But they're two really good players. One of them is the one who, you know the story? Beam, you know who that is?

Reporter ( 18:39 ):

You have to tell me.

President Trump ( 18:39 ):

He took Tiger, I guess 18 holes. Tiger went wild with his punting, meaning he started dropping punts from all over the place and Tiger took him, but that's the quality. They're really good players. Those two guys were… And terrific guys, two terrific guys. We had a good time, but I was watching. The only shot that mattered to me was the driver of the first hole because if I would've missed it, you would not have let me forget it.

Reporter ( 19:08 ):

Did you take a bit of a practice on the driving range beforehand?

President Trump ( 19:11 ):

I hit some… Yeah, I did. I hit some balls on the driver. It's a great course. It's a great course. It's been fantastic. I built one and then I had to build this one. Otherwise you would've lost your zone again for a certain period of time to build it. So they built it, it opened. My son did a very good job of building it.

Reporter ( 19:30 ):

You said you thought it would be the last dune course. Were you talking about environmental regulations?

President Trump ( 19:34 ):

Yeah. We obey the regulations, the environmental regulations. You really want to. And it's top of the line. It's really. The pros were saying this as good as any course they've ever played. It's as good as it gets.

Reporter ( 19:48 ):

The course was surrounded by windmills. Did you talk to Swarmer about the windmills?

President Trump ( 19:53 ):

I did, yeah. I think windmills are a disgrace. I think they hurt everything they touch. They're ugly. They're very inefficient. It's the most expensive form of energy there is. People hate it when they become visible from their house. When you see them from a house, the value goes down by 50% and more. They make noise. When they're out in the ocean they're bad for the sea life. Very bad for the whales, obviously, because they wash up and shore nine times more than they did without them.

( 20:24 ) No, they are really bad and they cost a lot of money. There's not a wind farm that's put up without subsidies. Instead of making money, what they should do is open up the whole North Coast oil. They have tremendous oil right there, right where we play. And they made it impossible for people to drill. It's crazy.

( 20:50 ) I mean, that's one of the best oil areas in the world. They've made it impossible for people to take it out. Instead, they put up these ugly windmills all over the country and all over the world. I don't know what it is. Nobody likes them. They have the greatest lobby, but I think I'm starting to get to it now. They're bad energy. They look bad. They killed the birds. They're really terrible things. And it's the most expensive energy of any energy there is. And in fact, every… I mean, not every, I guess, I don't know, maybe some, but almost every windmill put up needs subsidy from the government. So instead of making money, they lose money. And that's why UK energy costs are very high because when we were flying over to the plane, they're all over the place. It's terrible. It's a terrible thing. I'll say it till I can't speak anymore. But I think we are having an impact and they're starting to take a lot of windmills down. I mean, they're literally starting to take them down. They don't work. They're bad and they're too costly. And every year you see them up there, the government is paying a lot of money. Whereas if you have oil, if you have other forms of energy, you make money on it. In other words, you bring down taxes.

Reporter ( 22:04 ):

Well, your friend Bryson DeChambeau said that LIV tour players weren't playing enough links golf. Is that something we might see at-

President Trump ( 22:12 ):

Well, links golf is just different golf. It's quite a bit different. I love Bryson. Bryson's great. He's a great player, very powerful guy. Long hitter, great putter, great everything. And it's interesting, he plays well in a links course.

Reporter ( 22:27 ):

But is that in the future for the greatest 36?

President Trump ( 22:30 ):

Oh, yeah. I mean, look, we have a tournament this weekend there and we have another tournament next weekend, big tournaments. And we're looking to get the Irish open at Doonbeg. I have a course at Doonbeg in Ireland. And we have a lot of great tournaments coming to mind. I build the best courses. That's not only said by me, that's said by everybody.

Reporter ( 22:53 ):

Back to Russia, sir. Since you made the announcement of the 10 to 12 days, have you gotten any feedback or any officials gotten any feedback that had had a response that Russia is going to do something?

President Trump ( 23:06 ):

No, I haven't yet. I haven't had any response. It's a shame. So I used to say to you, "5,000 people die a week." Now it's 7,000 people are dying a week. Mostly Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, but people also from having bombs dropped on their head. The disgusting war.

Reporter ( 23:29 ):

How worried are you on the oil markets if you were to put sanctions on Russia?

President Trump ( 23:32 ):

I don't worry about it. We have so much oil in our country. We'll just step it up even further. I mean oil is down pretty low right now. We'll step it up even further.

Reporter ( 23:42 ):

One of the-

( 23:43 ) Sorry. I heard you mention compression. How were you feeling out there when you were playing? How did you feel? I think it's the first time you played since you saw the dog, right?

President Trump ( 23:51 ):

I felt good. I thought it was great. I thought the course was great. It looks even more beautiful than I thought. We did the first one 11 years, 12 years ago, and it's gotten tremendous reviews. It's one of the best courses in the world. And I had the other piece of land to do this one also on the ocean and the North Sea.

( 24:12 ) And by the way, the North Sea is the exact term for the oil. They have among the greatest reserves. It's tremendous. And they're not using it. Instead, they're putting up these stupid windmills. It's so crazy. UK could reduce their energy costs by 70% if they would use the North Sea oil. It just doesn't make sense. It's just not a Liberal thing to do, but it's becoming more of a Liberal thing to do. I love being out there. It was great. Good feeling.

Reporter ( 24:45 ):

Mr. President, UK and the US both have increasingly unhealthy populations.

President Trump ( 24:51 ):

Is that what they say?

Reporter ( 24:51 ):

Yeah. We do.

President Trump ( 24:53 ):

Well, I can see it.

Reporter ( 24:54 ):

I'm interested in the work that-

President Trump ( 24:55 ):

No, I can see it.

Reporter ( 24:55 ):

… makes competitors are healthy again.

President Trump ( 24:57 ):

I can see it. I should think about it for myself. Bobby is doing a great job. People are loving Bobby Kennedy and the whole group, Dr. Ross, Marty Makary. We have a fantastic group and you're going to see a lot of things happening over the next couple of months. I mean, true activists. And they're going with the science. And if you take a look at some of the problems, some of the diseases that are coming up to a level that we've never seen before, there's something wrong. There's something wrong and I think we're going to solve the problem. But he's really working hard.

( 25:38 ) All we're doing now is stats, statistics. And I think we're going to make a big change. We're going to save a lot of lives. When the babies are born and they end up having problems that they've never had before and by 15 and 20 times more. So there's something wrong and we're going to find what it is pretty soon. We think pretty soon.

Reporter ( 25:59 ):

Mr. President, Epstein has a certain reputation, obviously. Just curious, were some of the workers that were taken from you, were some of them young women?

President Trump ( 26:09 ):

Were some of them?

Reporter ( 26:10 ):

Were some of them young women?

President Trump ( 26:12 ):

Well, I don't want say, but everyone knows the people that were taken. It was, the concept of taking people that work for me is bad. But that story has been pretty well out there. And the answer is yes, they were.

Reporter ( 26:28 ):

Yes, they were young women?

( 26:29 ) What did they do?

President Trump ( 26:29 ):

In the spa.

Reporter ( 26:30 ):

In the jobs in the spa?

President Trump ( 26:32 ):

Yeah, people that work in the spa. I have a great spa, one of the best spas in the world at Mar-a-Lago. And people were taken out of the spa, hired by him. In other words, gone. And other people would come and complain, "This guy is taking people from the spa." I didn't know that. Then when I heard about it, I told him, I said, "Listen, we don't want you taking our people." Whether it was spa or not spa. I don't want him taking people. He was fine.

President Trump ( 27:00 ):

And then, not too long after that he did it again, and I said, "Out of here."

Speaker 17 ( 27:05 ):

Mr. President, did one of those stolen persons, does that include Virginia Giuffre.

President Trump ( 27:13 ):

I don't know. I think she worked at the spa. I think so. I think that was one of the people, yeah. He stole her. And by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know, none whatsoever.

Speaker 17 ( 27:28 ):

We've seen how good your security detail is this weekend and the team around you have done a good job.

President Trump ( 27:34 ):

They've done a good job.

Speaker 17 ( 27:34 ):

Amazing. Do you have any answers yet, as to what happened with the assassination attempt. Having seen them in action it seems remarkable that that was-

President Trump ( 27:43 ):

You mean the assassination with… They just weren't as good that day. They had a bad day. They shouldn't have had a roof that was unpatrolled. They should have had coordination with the local police because you had a lot of talk going on. You had the woman screaming, "There's a man up there with a gun." And a number of people were screaming, "There's a guy up there with a gun," and they didn't have…

( 28:10 ) The one group wasn't hooked into the other group. I'll tell you, the Secret Service shooter, David, was amazing, because in four seconds, it was over. And if this lunatic was allowed to keep shooting, because they had tens of thousands of people there, so a lot of people could have been killed. We lost a great person and two people very badly injured. But the shooter, one bullet. Think of that, one bullet from a very far distance. It's amazing.

Speaker 17 ( 28:42 ):

Has it changed you?

President Trump ( 28:43 ):

So, he was great.

Speaker 17 ( 28:45 ):

Do you feel like he's changed you as a person?

President Trump ( 28:48 ):

I don't know. Maybe and maybe not, but I like to not think about it. It affects some people greatly. I can't afford to be affected, because I have a job to do, so I like not to think about it.

Speaker 16 ( 29:01 ):

Does it not go?

President Trump ( 29:02 ):

I think about it too much, it's probably not a good thing.

Speaker 16 ( 29:05 ):

Does it not go through your mind at all, in the morning? Like this morning when you're outside? There's a crowd and-

President Trump ( 29:09 ):

I don't think about it. I think you see the kind of protection now. I think they're very good. It's a whole different level.

( 29:18 ) Look, these people went to Biden, and Biden's people, and asked for more help because I was having rallies. 60,000, 70,000 people. I had 115,000 people. And Biden would have two people. Nobody wanted to see the guy. And he'd have a bigger security detail than I had.

( 29:39 ) And they were asking, Sean and the various people were asking for more people, and they were denied. So they denied them. And so you could make that case. I don't think they've made that case well, because I knew for a fact that they were asking for more people a lot.

( 29:56 ) They have said it, but not that publicly. But they wanted more people, and the Biden people would not give it to them. And we had massive crowds. You were there. We would have routinely 50, 60, 70,000 people. And he would have nobody, he couldn't fill the circles, the eight circles, and he didn't need very many people. And so that was a problem too.

Speaker 16 ( 30:24 ):

Can I ask about the first lady? You mentioned a couple of weeks ago, her role in talking to you about the war in Ukraine. Perhaps a big part of your evolution in thinking, have you discussed the crisis in Gaza and the terrifying-

President Trump ( 30:36 ):

I have, she thinks it's terrible and she sees the same pictures that you see, and that we all see. And I think everybody, unless they're pretty cold-hearted or worse than that, nuts, there's nothing you can say other than it's terrible when you see the kids, and those are kids, whether they talk starvation or not, those are kids that are starving. I mean, they are starving.

( 31:03 ) And you see the mothers, they love them so much and there's just nothing they seem to be able to do. They got to get them food and we're going to get them food.

Speaker 16 ( 31:11 ):

Do you plan to attend the G20 summit this year?

President Trump ( 31:13 ):

I don't think so, no. I think maybe I'll send somebody else, because I've had a lot of problems with South Africa and they have some very bad policies, very, very bad policies, like policies where people are being killed, a lot of people are being killed.

( 31:31 ) So I think I probably won't any updates. I'd like to, but I don't think I will.

Speaker 17 ( 31:36 ):

Any update on when you'll meet with President Xi? When can we expect that?

President Trump ( 31:40 ):

Oh, he wants to meet. And I look forward to the meeting too. But I would say before the end of the year, I mean, just to go full circle, so we had a very good meeting today, if you would've asked me the question yesterday, no, it wasn't looking too good. I would've said… Maybe I might've said nothing, but I might've also said it wasn't going too good. I just heard from Scott that the meeting went very well today with China.

( 32:06 ) Thank you all very much. Enjoy the flight. Thank you.

Speaker 17 ( 32:09 ):

Thank you.
