Speaker 1 ( 00:00 ):

We begin this evening’s broadcast with still more bad news for former President Donald J. Trump. Not long ago, after more than four hours of a closed door meeting, the House Ways and Means Committee voted to release six years of Donald Trump’s tax returns to the public. Trump, of course, has spent years battling to keep his returns secret. Lawmakers say it could take a few more days to redact the documents before they’re released. But tonight the committee did release two reports on Trump’s tax returns. One of the big takeaways, lawmakers say the IRS failed to audit former President Trump’s tax filings while he was in office, despite a longstanding agency policy that makes the auditing of sitting presidents mandatory. Here’s how the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee put it earlier this evening.

Speaker 2 ( 00:49 ):

For all practical purposes, the research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was non-existent. The tax forms were really never audited, and only my sending a letter at one point prompted sort of a rear view mirror response.

Speaker 1 ( 01:13 ):

We got a lot to get into on that, but meanwhile, the January 6th committee is expected to release its final report tomorrow. Today we learned the Select Committee has already begun turning documents and transcripts over to the Department of Justice.
