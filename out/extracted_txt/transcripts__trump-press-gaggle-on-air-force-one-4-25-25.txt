Speaker 2 ( 00:00 ):

[inaudible 00:00:02].

President Trump ( 00:00 ):

It's pretty surprising, the ceremony.

Speaker 2 ( 00:00 ):

You've said that you've spoken to President Xi multiple times. Is that since taking office, sir?

President Trump ( 00:00 ):

I don't want to discuss that. Speaking to a lot of people from China, speaking to people from all over the world about the tariffs and we're making very good deals. Very good deals. We're going to be making our very country rich. We're not going to be ripped off like we have been for the last literally fifty years.

Speaker 3 ( 00:00 ):

There was a car bomb in Moscow this morning that killed a Russian general. Do have a reaction to that and the impact [inaudible 00:00:18].

President Trump ( 00:00 ):

A car bomb? Well, no I just heard, you're just telling me that for the first time. Where did this take place?

Speaker 3 ( 00:00 ):

It took place in Moscow, it was a Russian general

President Trump ( 00:00 ):

That's really close to home. That's a big one. I look at it, if I hear anything I'll let you know.

Speaker 4 ( 00:00 ):

So when you see these leaders it's more of like a mix and mingle at the funeral or are you having individual one on ones?

President Trump ( 00:18 ):

That's a little tough because we don't have much time, and we're arriving at 11:30 and we have some people meeting us already and then I'm taking pictures from the military tonight before we get to the house at twelve o'clock at the embassy. So we don't really have much time, and as you know tomorrow morning we start leaving early. We're going to try to see a couple people that are important to what we're doing.

Speaker 4 ( 00:19 ):

Why did you feel it was important to go to the Pope's funeral?

President Trump ( 00:20 ):

I just thought it was out of respect here, I won the Catholic vote, and I think that's the first time that ever happened where a Republican won the vote and I won it by a lot. You know I have a great relationship to the Catholics. I won the Catholic vote. I got fifty-six percent of the vote, I don't know why we didn't get more, but we did well with the Catholic vote, and my relationship is very good so therefore I think is appropriate [inaudible 00:02:15].

Speaker 4 ( 00:54 ):

Secretary Bessent said that you wouldn't drop tariffs on China unilaterally, that you would need to see some kind of movement. What do you want to see from China?

President Trump ( 03:55 ):

Well I'm not going to drop them unless they give us something substantial, otherwise I'm not going to drop them. It'll all work out, those things always work out. You know we're working on a lot of projects right now. The wall is on, the boarder is the most secure it's ever been. We're having a very hard time with judges, because they don't want people to be moved out of the country. Shockingly, nobody's ever had this before, no other President, there's never been a time where this has ever become an issue. When they talk about due process, when you have millions of people that you're moving out, that are really bad people, very dangerous people, and you have a judge who wants every single one of them to have a trial.

( 03:55 ) So they want to set millions of trials, therefore, and how long does the trial take? Weeks? The trial cold take weeks. That's not what it's about, that's not what our country is about, and that's not why I got elected. And these are judges, they just want to show how big and important they are. They are local, Federal judges, and they shouldn't be allowed to do it. We have hundreds of thousands of people who want to get out of the country, and the courts are holding us back. It's very dangerous for our country. You want to see a country that'll have crime? Let that happen, because it's really dangerous for our country and I can't believe the Supreme Court would let that stand.

Speaker 2 ( 04:05 ):

What do you consider substantial from China?

President Trump ( 04:10 ):

Well, free up China. Let us go in and work China because frankly that's what we wanted last time we almost got it and then they backed out of that deal. But we had it to go into China and to sell our product, sell our wares. In other words it's called to open China. That would be great. That would be a big win. But I'm not even sure I'm going to ask for it because they don't want it open. They don't want it open.

Speaker 4 ( 04:40 ):

On the immigration front think, of the tariffs.

President Trump ( 04:45 ):

But because of tariffs I could possibly get that. What do you think opening up China would be a big win. Right? The problem is no matter how big the win is, the press will not give me credit for it. If I got the greatest win in history, if I got --, they'll pay us trillions and trillions of dollars. They'll give us anything we want. The press will say Trump, he just had a terrible defeat. He suffered a terrible defeat. But the people know. Now I think we're going to have a lot of big wins. I don't know if it's going to be covered that way by the fake news, but the wins are going to be very substantial.

( 05:25 ) We were losing, with Biden 5 billion a day. Think of that, 5 billion a day. I've got that number way down and soon it's going to be very, very positive. We're going to make, we'll be making 5 billion a day, but we have a little ways to go yet, a little less.

Speaker 2 ( 05:47 ):

Can I ask you about the Texas Senate primary, the Texas Senate primary with John Cornyn and Ken Paxton. You going to get involved? Have you talked to the candidates?

President Trump ( 05:54 ):

Well, they're both friends of mine. I like them both. In a way I wish they weren't running against each other. But I like Paxton. I like Cornyn. They're both good people. So I'll make a decision somewhere along the lines. But you have two very good men.

Speaker 3 ( 06:10 ):

I have a question on your immigration agenda. Yesterday a judge in San Francisco, put a nationwide injunction on you guys taking money away from sanctuary cities. Your reaction to that? Then I have a question about the markets.

President Trump ( 06:23 ):

That's Unbelievable. When you hear a judge in San Francisco or a judge in San Diego, does nationwide injunctions having to do with a whole country sitting behind a bench, a local bench, even though in some cases, in many cases they're a federal judge, but a judge can close down. We should close down sanctuary cities. We shouldn't have sanctuary cities and we'll see how that turns out. But sanctuary cities are sanctuary for criminals. That's what they are. They're sanctuary for criminals. They protect criminals and we should close them down if we want a safe country, you have to get rid of sanctuary cities,

Speaker 3 ( 07:03 ):

India and Pakistan. There are tensions after the attack in Kashmir. You got any message for them? Are you going to be talking to their leaders?

President Trump ( 07:11 ):

India and I'm very close to Pakistan as you know, and they've had that fight for a thousand years in Kashmir.

( 07:18 ) Kashmir has been going on for a thousand years, probably longer than that and it was a bad one yesterday though. That was a bad one. Over 30 people.

Speaker 3 ( 07:29 ):

Are you concerned that there's now tensions on the border between them? Are you concerned about, how are you concerned about that?

President Trump ( 07:35 ):

There are tensions on that border for 1,500 years. So it's the same as it's been, but they'll get it figured out one way or the other. I'm sure that is. I know both leaders, there's great tension between Pakistan and India, but there always has been.

Speaker 4 ( 07:56 ):

So you've done the one ninety-day pause on some of the tariffs. Is it possible you'll have to do another -- or another extension?

President Trump ( 08:05 ):

Of the pause? Think I know pretty much. And again, we'll have deals made, but we'll also make deals. Otherwise we'll just set the tariff and we'll be reasonable. -- very reasonable and that'll be the end. It's the deal. We set the price they want to come in now they set the price for their country, but everybody wants to come into ours. They don't want to come into theirs. Most people don't want to come into theirs.

Speaker 4 ( 08:30 ):

Do you think the markets are adjusting to your tariff policy?

President Trump ( 08:34 ):

So when you look at what's happening? I think so. I said there'd be a transition. People haven't understood it. Now they're starting to understand. Look, think of it this way. We've lost billions of dollars a day for years on trade. Millions. Not going to happen. We're going to make billions of dollars a day. That's not sustainable.

Speaker 3 ( 08:58 ):

Can you commit that nobody on your financial team was giving any type of tips to Wall Street executives about deals with India? There was some reporting yesterday that people had heads up on Wall Street possibly to make money. Can you commit that? That did not happen.

President Trump ( 09:11 ):

I can commit to myself. That's all I can commit. I have thousands of people that work for me, but I can't imagine anybody doing it. I have very honorable people that I can say so I can't even imagine it, but no, I haven't even heard that actually.

Speaker 2 ( 09:27 ):

Sir. There have been some concerns about access to food medicine coming into Gaza. When you spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu the other day, did that come up at all about access and humanitarian aid going into the Strip?

President Trump ( 09:39 ):

No. Gaza came up and I said, we've got to be good to Gaza. Those people are suffering. We've got to be good to Gaza. We're going to take care of that. There's a very big need for medicine, --, food and Medicine -- and we're taking care of it.

Speaker 2 ( 09:55 ):

In terms of opening up more access points or.

President Trump ( 09:58 ):

We are --.

Speaker 2 ( 09:59 ):

Mostly the Israelis? Are you going to open up more access points?

President Trump ( 10:05 ):

To get food and medicine into Gaza.

Speaker 2 ( 10:07 ):

How did the Prime Minister respond to that?

President Trump ( 10:08 ):

Well he felt well about it.

Speaker 4 ( 10:11 ):

You've got these Iran technical talks tomorrow in Omaha. What do you do you think-

President Trump ( 10:20 ):

The Iran situation's coming out very well. We've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That'd be good for humanity.

Speaker 4 ( 10:32 ):

You can start with an interim deal of some sort or how is it going to work?

President Trump ( 10:36 ):

I think it's going to be pretty much --. We're not looking to do lots of long-term. It's very simple deal. One thing they just can't have a nuclear weapon. I'm saving them a lot of money just on that. Having a nuclear weapon is really expensive but it's also very dangerous and they can't have a nuclear weapon and just that -- I'm saving them billions and billions of dollars, what it would cost. Now with that being said, the Iran deal is coming along very well. We are dealing at the highest levels of Iran and I think they want to make a deal and we want to make a deal. There are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal, a much nastier deal and I don't want that to happen to Iran, if we can avoid it. Thank you very much everybody.

Speaker 2 ( 11:23 ):

Thank you sir.

Speaker 4 ( 11:23 ):

What's on tap for Melania's birthday?

President Trump ( 11:24 ):

Oh, she's going to have a great birthday. She's got a working birthday. She's up front. I should send her back. You want to have somebody answer a question? I'll send her back into the lion's bed. Susie, let's send Melania back to the lion's bed. That's funny.

Speaker 2 ( 11:43 ):

Are you taking her to dinner, Mr. President?

President Trump ( 11:45 ):

By the way, they would love that one. Whether-

Speaker 2 ( 11:47 ):

Are you going to be taking her to dinner?

Speaker 3 ( 11:47 ):

We see your office up there sometime, this weekend.

President Trump ( 11:53 ):

You can come up. We'll let them come up a little bit later. Okay, we'll do it.

Speaker 2 ( 11:57 ):

Are you taking Melania to dinner?

Speaker 5 ( 12:01 ):

Or have you had time to get her a present? You've been very busy.

President Trump ( 12:03 ):

I'll take her for dinner on the Boeing. I'll take her for dinner on Air Force One. Haven't had much time due to my presidency. We've been pretty busy, but it's working out. Things are working out very well and people are starting to understand how good tariffs are for us and tariffs have been used against us for 50 years now.

( 12:27 ) I never understood it as a private person, why we allowed that to happen. It goes back a long time, but I never understood it. Why did we allow that to happen where we couldn't go into China but they could come here. We couldn't go into Europe, but they could come here. So many, every place. We couldn't go into India, they could come here. I never understood why they allowed that and I don't blame the countries. I blame the presidents for allowing it to happen. But you have a different kind of a president now, so thank you very much.
