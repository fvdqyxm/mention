Speaker 1 ( 08:45 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 2024 College Football National Champions, the Ohio State University Buckeyes.

Group ( 09:57 ):

Speaker 2 ( 11:24 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States, accompanied by the vice president of the United States and Ryan Day, head coach of the Ohio State University Buckeyes.

President Trump ( 11:38 ):

That's a good-looking group behind me. And they're big. We're not going to get into any fights with them, I can guarantee you.

( 11:39 ) So I want to just congratulate everybody. Coach, you have done some job, man. But today is my great honor to welcome the 2024 College Football National Champions, The Ohio State University. And it turns out January 20th was a big day for all of us. That's true. That was a big day. I love that day. I won't forget that day. To Ohio State President Ted Carter… Ted, where is Ted?… Ted, congratulations. Good job, man. Athletic Director Ross Bjork. Ross, where is Ross? [inaudible 00:13:20], congratulations. Did you not know they were this good? He said, "Absolutely." That's a good answer.

( 13:38 ) To Coach Ryan Day, who… and I have to read this because this is not part of it, but they gave me a little briefing. I knew how good a coach… I didn't know he was that good. It's Ryan Day, head coach of The Ohio State University. So here's just a little summary. Ryan was named head coach in December 2018. Think of this, first of all, he's a very young looking guy, he's got a lot of time left. In his six seasons as head coach, Day has led the team to nine championship wins. You don't do that. He's currently the only coach to lead his team to the College Football Playoffs four times since 2019, and his first season as head coach and his overall coaching record 70 and 10. So in other words, Ryan, I'd like to be your agent. I want to represent you. And he won the big one, right? He won the big one. That's the biggest of all. That's fantastic. Let me have you. It's an amazing achievement at a young age.

( 14:29 ) And to the entire team and everybody up here, we want to thank you and congratulate you. There's this building behind you, there's nothing like it. I have a lot of buildings. This is the one… this one you can't beat. The White House. And I think the coach was all excited about it. I threw it out just hoping that it wouldn't be a big deal. I said, "Coach Edwards, if you'd like, but only if you like, don't worry about it. We could take the team down to the Oval Office and show them what the Oval Office is because it is spectacular." And I don't know if the floor could withstand it, that's the only thing. But we're going to do that. And I've done some Trump touches to the Oval Office. It's a little nicer than it used to be, I think.

Speaker 3 ( 15:22 ):

A lot nicer.

President Trump ( 15:30 ):

Most people… A lot nicer, you're right about that. No, it's special. Everything begins, ends and re-begins at the Oval Office. So we're going to take the team down there right when we finish, okay? If anyone doesn't want to go, that'll be okay. Who's going, everybody? We look forward to it.

( 15:46 ) Also with us are many Ohio State fans from my administration. And the biggest of them all, of course, is our vice president, who's been fantastic. [inaudible 00:16:03] JD Vance. JD [inaudible 00:16:03]. But he was such a good student, he didn't stay there for four years. He got out in two years, number one in his class. How do you do that? Did you have any better students than that? Better football players, yes. But JD's doing a great job. Thanks as well to Secretary of State Marco Rubio for being here. Marco, you're doing incredible. Thank you. As well as Representatives Warren Davidson and Mike Carey. Fellows, thank you. Thank you, thank you very much.

( 16:22 ) Governor Mike DeWine. Mike, where are you? Hi, Mike. Doing a great job. Attorney General Dave Yost. Dave, congratulations on everything. Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Frank, thank you, Frank. Mayor Trent Conaway. I love Trent Conaway. Where's Trent Conaway? Where are you, Trent? You look at him, that guy from East Palestine. I think you're the reason they say that was… I visited and Biden didn't. And when I went there and I went there right after the problem, right? And I met Trent and I love Trent. But a lot of people give you a lot of credit for the success that we've had 'cause we won in a huge stampede, in a landslide, and I want to thank you. You've been a great mayor and you went through a lot, and we took care of you. We helped and other people did. But you were a big stop in the first one. So thank you for being here. It's good to see you again.

Speaker 4 ( 17:33 ):

[inaudible 00:17:34].

President Trump ( 17:35 ):

Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:17:37].

( 17:35 ) And of course, the Ohio State legend, he's a current lieutenant governor, Jim Tressel. Where's Jim? Thank you. Thank you, Jim. Thank you very much and he's a legend. Thanks also to my friends JJ Cafaro and the Schottenstein family. They here somewhere. There they are. Hi, fellows, good to have you.

( 18:06 ) This was a historic year in college football. Standing together today, these men are the first… think about it, the first college football players in history who can proudly call themselves 12-team Playoff Champions. You're the first ones. You're the first ones. Congratulations, coach. This team showed the world that the road to greatness is paved by hard work, sweat, and often a great deal of adversity. They had a lot of adversity because… I shouldn't say this, I actually said, "Should I leave this line out? And they said, "Sir," and you said, "Yes, leave it." "Sir, they want to hear the whole thing." The bad and the good, right? But many people counted you out, as you know, after the losses against Oregon, which is a great team and that team up north.

Group ( 18:59 ):

Yeah.

President Trump ( 18:59 ):

But you refused to let the Buckeye Nation down. You got better and better and tougher and tougher as the season went along. And after a very strong regular season, but with adversity, you held a closed-door players-only meeting. This extraordinary group rallied together for a single glorious mission, to win four straight playoff games against the finest teams in college football. And you were able to do it, obviously.

( 19:27 ) In the first playoff game, Tennessee quarterback, Will Howard, scorched the volunteer defense. I watched that game. I said, "That guy is good." Defense for 311 yards and completed 24 of 29 passes. Known for his accuracy, strong arm, but boy is he known for his… Where is Will? I want to see this guy.

President Trump ( 20:00 ):

You are fantastic. Oh, he's going to be so rich. Think of that. To look like that and to play, that's a good combination. But Will went on to set an all-time college football player of record with 1,150 yards passing. That's an incredible thing. Thank you. We'll be watching him for about 15 years, maybe longer. The next game was a chance at redemption against the top ranked Oregon Ducks, which was a tough team. It was a total team effort by Ohio State. In the first half, the Buckeyes built an insurmountable 34 point lead thanks to the scores from veteran playmaker Treveyon Henderson. Where is he? Treveyon. [inaudible 00:21:01] You think I could beat him in a race? I don't. Great going. And Ohio State. And also your reception's leader Emeka Egbuka. Where is he? Look at this guy. Congratulations fellas. How important were they to your passing?

Speaker 5 ( 21:31 ):

Oh, they were everything.

President Trump ( 21:34 ):

That's good. You said the right thing. Then came the team's biggest test in the semifinals. A trip to Texas for the Cotton Bowl, and that Texas was pretty much rated the number one team at the beginning of the season. Right? So that was a tough team. I know that. It was neck and neck. Late in the fourth quarter, Texas was down a score. But marching in the red zone with two minutes left on the fourth and eight, with 2:29 on the clock. Hometown legend Jack Sawyer… Boy, that's a good name.

( 22:05 ) Jack Sawyer. It sounds like the name of a legend, right? A son of Columbus. We won Columbus by a lot of points. I like it too. Gave the world an all-time great Ohio State football moment. Most of you know what I'm talking about. In one amazing play, Jack exploded off the line. Strip-sacked the quarterback, which is not easy to do. Scooped the fumble recovery, scored an 83-yard touchdown return and punched Ohio State's ticket to the championship game. Yeah, it's a hell of a thing. You mean you took the ball out of the quarterback's head? I don't want to say this. I don't want to make… How do you think that other team field? Not too good. That's one of those disasters for another team, right? Oh, that quarterback doesn't feel good. Where is he? I want to see this guy. [inaudible 00:23:02]

Speaker 6 ( 23:05 ):

Phenomenal.

President Trump ( 23:05 ):

Are you that fast? [inaudible 00:23:06].

Speaker 6 ( 23:07 ):

I had some great blockers leading the way [inaudible 00:23:10] probably.

President Trump ( 23:10 ):

That's unbelievable actually. Size of these guys. I used to think I was quite a big fellow. Not so much anymore. But he later said that it was the best feeling he'd ever felt. Are you sure about that, Jack? I don't know about that. As he gets older, who knows, but I don't think he's ever going to forget it. And Jack, you earned it and congrats. That's really a special. So you thought that game, it was maybe over coach. What do you think?

Speaker 7 ( 23:42 ):

That's when I felt like we were going to win.

President Trump ( 23:42 ):

You felt like it was going to… That's why he's a good coach. He felt he was going to win. That was pretty amazing. And the other team was tough, right?

Speaker 7 ( 23:51 ):

They were good team.

President Trump ( 23:52 ):

Will they be good again this season?

Speaker 7 ( 23:54 ):

We open up the first game with them next year.

President Trump ( 23:56 ):

Oh, you have the first game with them. Wow. That's tough. And a lot of your players are coming back, but quite a few great ones are leaving, right?

Speaker 7 ( 24:03 ):

To the NFL.

President Trump ( 24:04 ):

How do you feel about… To the NFL. That's the good thing about every one of them goes. How do you feel about the season?

Speaker 7 ( 24:11 ):

That's going to be exciting.

President Trump ( 24:12 ):

Better be good.

Speaker 7 ( 24:12 ):

We're going to miss some of these guys. But we've got good young guys and we're excited about next season.

President Trump ( 24:16 ):

I bet you're going to do great. But the Buckeyes had defied the critics, but the job just wasn't finished. This tremendous team needed one more win for the ultimate victory. The national championship game against Notre Dame. Offensive MVP, Will Howard led the charge again completing 14 of his first 15… I'm telling you, the guy has an accurate arm. How many times do I have to tell you that. Quinshon Judkins reached the end zone three times. Where the hell is he? [inaudible 00:24:55] Three times defensive MVP, Cody Simon, stuffed the fighting Irish rushing attack. Where's Cody?

( 25:14 ) Do you notice the way they're sitting in like a little trench? I didn't want them at the same level actually. But I feel very good about that, J.D, right?

JD Vance ( 25:24 ):

Yes sir.

President Trump ( 25:25 ):

Keep them down a little bit. But offensive MVP, Will Howard led that charge. And really these people are going places that are going to be very exciting in the future. We're going to be watching them all on Sundays and for a long time to come. I believe many of them, many of the people behind us. But Cody Simon, that was a very important deal. And Buckeye star, Jeremiah Smith pulled down the unforgettable deep ball on third and 11 to clinch the championship. Where's Jeremiah? [inaudible 00:25:56]

( 25:55 ) Oh, I shouldn't say this, but the coach was giving Jeremiah some major praise backstage. I said, "So what's the future?" He said, "Well, we have a guy. He may be the best ever." That's a lot to think about Jeremiah. Just be real good. You could be Jerry Rice, right? Who's your favorite?

Speaker 8 ( 26:28 ):

Jerry Rice.

President Trump ( 26:28 ):

Jerry Rice. Jerry Rice was a great guy too. But Jeremiah was the only freshman that was just at a level that few people have ever seen before, according to what I hear. And nobody could stop them all year long, even as a freshman. And let's not forget the resilient offensive line that helped Will achieve this record-breaking season. Get ready fellas. Come on up here. Josh Fryer, Luke Montgomery, Carlson Heinsman, Tegra Tshabola, Austin Siereveld and Donovan Jackson stepped up when you needed him most and they protected this valuable quarterback.

Speaker 9 ( 27:23 ):

Thank you Mr. President. [inaudible 00:27:29].

President Trump ( 27:34 ):

Oh wow. It's nice one. They can say we're going to the NFL with… Other people said, they got to come back. You going early from what I hear. Good luck, fellas.

Speaker X ( 27:42 ):

Thank you, sir.

President Trump ( 27:43 ):

Good luck in the NFL.

Speaker X ( 27:48 ):

Thank you, sir.

President Trump ( 27:48 ):

Fantastic.

Speaker X ( 27:48 ):

Thanks sir.

President Trump ( 27:48 ):

I'm looking at him. What's he doing?

JD Vance ( 27:50 ):

I'm short compared to these guys, sir.

President Trump ( 27:53 ):

Thank you. Great job.

JD Vance ( 27:54 ):

Thank you all.

President Trump ( 28:01 ):

That's so important. That offensive line is so important. You have no idea. I've seen teams that were great, but they didn't have the offensive line and it just doesn't work out, right Will?

Speaker 10 ( 28:12 ):

Right.

President Trump ( 28:12 ):

You beat the fighting Irish that day, 34-23. And for the first time in 10 years, proudly claimed the title of the great state of Ohio, the great state. I love that state. We won that state in a landslide Governor. We want it in a landslide. I love Ohio. We'll never let you down, I swear. I promise. And if I let you down, he won't. Okay, so you have a backup. But I do love the place. And so today I'm honored to call the Ohio State University Buckeyes National Champions. You're the national champions and you're standing right here at the White House. And it's a proud day for all of us, but it's a proud day for the Scarlet and Gray.

( 28:54 ) Congratulations once again, and coach, you are a fantastic person. I got to know him just a little bit back there and I realized almost immediately that he's really a special guy. And to your wife and your three beautiful children, congratulations. And I'm going to ask J.D to say a couple of words. It's an honor to have everybody at the White House. You are a very special group from a special state, the state of Ohio. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.

JD Vance ( 29:28 ):

Well, thank you Mr. President. Thanks to Coach Day and the entire team for being here at the White House. I'm so proud to be part of Team Scarlet and Gray today. Congratulations to the Ohio State Buckeyes on a hell of a 2024 season. Now, I want to say just a couple of words about this team because they really helped make, sir, an incredible year even better for this very proud Ohio State alum. So two things. First of all, I made a bet with Ted Cruz over the Texas game, a bet that he is still not paid up on.

JD Vance ( 30:00 ):

Ted Cruz, if you're watching on TV, and I don't like losing any bet, but I really don't want to lose a bet to Ted Cruz. So thank you all for helping me win that bet against Ted Cruz. And the second thing, I asked the President on January the 20th, I said, "Sir, would you mind if I skipped that Final Inaugural Ball to go to the Ohio State National Championship game?" And the President said, "No, but we'll have them at the White House." So here we are, celebrating that national title. And I just want to say I'm proud of you guys. You guys were resilient, you were tough. You represented the state of Ohio well, and you represented the whole country well.

( 30:31 ) And the last thing that I'll say is I don't know who let the guy over in the corner here in a Michigan hat enter this celebration, but I'm about to tell the Secret Service you've got a dangerous weapon, sir. But I just want to say, "Proud of this team, Mr. President, thank you for hosting, and thanks to the whole state of Ohio for showing up and cheering for our Buckeyes." God bless you guys.

Ryan Day ( 31:06 ):

Thank you. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, and other distinguished guests, on behalf of the Ohio State University, the Department of Athletics, thank you for inviting the National Championship Ohio State Buckeyes to the White House this afternoon. I'd like to thank Ohio State President, Ted Carter, members of the Ohio delegation here with us today, Governor DeWine, Lieutenant Governor Tressel, Athletics Director Ross Bjork, and all the staff members for their work and efforts to make this trip to the White House a reality.

( 31:36 ) We're honored and humbled to be here, celebrating with you our ninth National Championship in our great university's history. To be here surrounded by our players, staff, university leadership is a moment we'll never forget. Traveling to DC though was the easy part, earning the right to be here was the hard one. This team made history by winning the most difficult series of games in the history of college football, defeating number seven, Tennessee, number one, Oregon in the Rose Bowl, number three, Texas in the Cotton Bowl, and number five, Notre Dame in National Championship, back to back to back to back. No team has ever done that. No team has ever done that. And through discipline and execution, this team dominated, finished the mission and left no doubt.

( 32:33 ) It all started with a group of fourth and fifth-year seniors. They chose each other. They chose Ohio State, and they built and lived a culture of brotherhood, toughness and love. When adversity hit, they stood tall, stuck together, showed their true character, rose to the occasion and became champions. There's a quote I love from President Roosevelt, displayed proudly in our team room, The Man in the Arena, "It's not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strongman stumbles. The credit belongs to the man who's actually in the arena, who strives valiantly, comes up short again and again, but who does actually strive to do the deeds." This quote reminds us of the true honor that belongs to those who rise to the challenge and stand in the arena un-wavered. It took every challenge and we responded with heart, with grit and with determination. That's why this moment means so much to us. Our families, thank you so much for your love and your support along the way. To our coaches, thank you for your hard work and for your leadership. And to our players, thank you for everything, your story will forever be told. And Mr. President, thank you again for this incredible honor. God bless America and Go Bucks.

Donald Trump ( 33:52 ):

Thank you very much. Great job.

Ryan Day ( 33:54 ):

All right. We have some really nice gifts that we're going to have our captains give Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.

( 34:00 ) All right.
