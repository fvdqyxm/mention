Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, accompanied by Erika Kirk.

Donald Trump ( 27:44 ):

Thank you very much, everybody. Please, this is such an honor. Please be seated. This is the first time we've been at the new and improved Rose Garden, and people are loving it. They're loving it like they've not loved a lot of things. We have the Presidential Walk of Fame, which you just saw and I just opened. We wanted to get it open for this occasion. We were hoping we were able to get outside and the weather allowed us to. It was supposed to be terrible rainy day. I was telling Erika, and God was watching, and he didn't want that for Charlie. He just didn't want that. So it's really beautiful. It couldn't be more beautiful.

( 28:33 ) Today, we're here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, beloved leader who galvanized the next generation like nobody I've ever seen before. And an American patriot of the deepest conviction, the finest quality in the highest caliber, the late, great Charlie Kirk. Five weeks ago, our nation was robbed of this extraordinary champion. He was a champion in every way I got to know him so well. He didn't like losing, and he was able to fight people that were enemies, and he didn't necessarily love those enemies so much. I heard he loved his enemies. And I said, "Wait a minute, is that the same Charlie that I know?" I'm not sure, but I didn't want to get into it. But it was a horrible, heinous, demonic act of murder.

( 29:35 ) He was assassinated in the prime of his life for boldly speaking the truth, for living his faith and relentlessly fighting for a better and stronger America. He loved his country. And that's why this afternoon, it's my privilege to posthumously award Charles James Kirk, our nation's highest civilian honor the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Thank you.

( 30:08 ) As you know, only hours ago, I returned from a very historic trip to secure peace in the Middle East. People said that couldn't be done. Charlie felt it could be done. Charlie felt it could be done. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

( 30:34 ) But I raced back halfway around the globe. I was going to call Erika and say, "Erika, could you maybe move it to Friday?" And I didn't have the courage to call. But you know why I didn't call? Because I heard today was Charlie's birthday. And I said, "Now, that was a definite." And I said, "We're going to have to forget about some of those very big, very rich countries that expected me to be there." And I can tell you based on the length of that flight, I wouldn't want to go back tomorrow, but I would not have missed this moment for anything in the world. Nothing.

( 31:11 ) And it's a very important time for our country, and our country is doing so well. It's never done better. We are a country with almost now $18 trillion of investment coming in. Nobody's ever seen anything like that. Previous administration at less than a trillion for four years. We have more than 18. It'll be much more than 20 by the time. More than $20 trillion. There's never been a country in the world that had anything like that. What's happened to our country is incredible in a short period of time.

( 31:43 ) Charlie was a big person for, "Sir, can we close up those borders please a little bit? They're really leaking badly." I said, "Charlie, I haven't gotten there yet." But it came out last four months, literally, nobody was allowed into our country, and the only people that were allowed in were people that came in legally. The borders are absolutely stone-cold closed, and they reported zero, zero, zero, and zero, so that's pretty good. But he was a big believer. He wanted people in the country more than I did, frankly. He wanted them to come in legally and he got his wish.

( 32:23 ) October 14th is Charlie's birthday, and he should have been turning 32 years old. I tell you, when I first met him, he was like 22. And I said, "Boy, he's awfully young." But I thought he was older than that. He looked a little bit older than his age. That's okay. That's not good when you're old, but when you're young, it's great. He had the best of all things, but he was special. But instead, Charlie is attaining a far more important milestone. We're entering his name forever into the eternal roster of true American heroes. He's a true American hero, an amazing person. Way, way beyond his years.

( 33:05 ) And I'm honored to be joined by a woman who has endured unspeakable hardship with unbelievable strength, and that's Charlie's widow, Erika. And I just want to thank you, Erika. He loved you so much. I was with him. Please. Thank you, Darling. Thank you.

( 33:34 ) I was with him before I met Erika, and he told me he was going to get married. He said, "You won't believe how beautiful she is." I said, "Well, then now that I meet her, he's right." But then he also said, "And you know what? She's like the smartest person I know." See, they do go together on occasion. Not often. Not often, but on occasion, they go together. But he was in love with you. He was deeply in love with you. It's great.

( 34:08 ) Erika, your love and courage have been an inspiration to all of us, and we will always be here for you, and we're always going to be here for your gorgeous, beautiful children. And we'll never forget what your family has sacrificed for our country. The man loved our country. When things were going badly for our country, he was so, as you know, angry. He would get angry, because he said, "It doesn't have to be that way."

( 34:35 ) We're also pleased to be joined by an incredible group of Charlie's friends, very powerful friends actually, and some not so powerful, and they were actually better people. Okay? I know about them. The less powerful ones, I have to tell you that all of you power guys down here. The best ones in the group are the ones that are less successful, but that happens too. No, they're all great, and they're here. And let's start with Erika's father.

( 35:02 ) Where is Erika's father? Where are you? Where are you, dad? Oh, look at him. Wow. I want to get a hat like that too. I like that. How are you? Nice to see you again. Thanks as well to Vice President JD Vance, who's been fantastic. JD, thank you very much. Great. Doing a great job. Did a great job on Sunday with George Stephanopoulos. Put him away pretty good. Second Lady, who's a phenomenal woman, Usha Vance. Thank you very much, Usha. Thank you very much. Great woman.

( 35:44 ) President of Argentina. He wanted to be here. Argentina is a serious flight, right? And he's become a superstar and he's doing amazing things. He's a MAGA person, but it's make Argentina great again. That's what he does, right? I want you to stand, please, Javier. Javier Milei. Doing a great job. Thank you very much.

( 36:13 ) Many members of my Cabinet are here. Just about all of them are here. I won't go into every single one of them, but I'll announce a few of the people that have really turned this country around and helped me. Incredible people. Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson. Where is Mike? Mike, what a job you're doing, Mike. What a job you're doing. And I watched you this morning and you're in there trying to say, "Look, just let the country open. Everything will be fine." We're dealing with some radical left lunatics, and I would just wish Charlie was here to fight us. I think the fight would've been over already. He would've had a march on the Capitol by people whose average age is about 21. Because there's nobody that had that relationship with young people, right Mike? So thank you, Mike for being here.

( 37:03 ) House Majority Leader, Steve Scalise. Steve, thank you very much. A brave guy and a friend. House Majority Whip, another terrific man, Tom Emmer. Tom? Thank you, Tom. Senate Majority Whip, John Barrasso. John, thank you very much. All these senators, I'm going to get in trouble. I'm not going to read all their names. I'll be reading all day, we'll be talking about Charlie in about 45 minutes from now. We can't do that. So all of the senators, there's so many of you, thank you very much.

( 37:41 ) I do want to thank Senator Thune for doing a terrific job. He's really been leading properly. Do you agree, Mike? The two of these guys have been fantastic. So to Senator Thune, I want to thank you very much. Incredible job. Watch him this morning and he was out there pounding this morning on television too. And John Barrasso, thank you for the work you've done and congratulations on your success. But I want to thank you all and all of the Congress people that are here, and I see we have our attorney general here and you are doing a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Pam. Thank you. Thank you very much.

( 38:18 ) We have everybody. Wow, that's incredible. Okay, I'm not going to do anymore. I'm going to be here too long, but I just want to thank you have given him such support, but he always gave you such support, that's why you're here. And very unusual. Charles James Kirk was a visionary and one of the greatest figures of his generation. He was truly an amazing figure and growing leaps and bounds. He knew that the fight to preserve our heritage is waged, not only on the battlefield and in the halls of power, of which we have tremendous power here, including the head of a place called war. We call it now war. We had defense, we had our Secretary of Defense, now we have a Secretary of War. And somehow, I think it's more emblematic and hopefully we'll never have to use war, but the fact that we're ready is very good.

( 39:12 ) Peace through strength is very important, but also in the hearts of our nation's youth. That's where Charlie rode strongest. At age 18, that insight inspired Charlie to found the organization that ultimately touched the lives of millions and millions of people and so many young people that nobody's ever seen like it frankly. Turning Point USA, it's amazing, and it's actually bigger now. It's become bigger in the last few weeks than Charlie ever thought.

( 39:46 ) I think his end vision in many years from now would've been just a fraction of what it turned out to be in a couple of weeks, right? It's amazing. With hard work and joyful spirit and endless enthusiasm and determination, and he did have great enthusiasm. [inaudible 00:40:02] to be successful, he had great enthusiasm.

( 40:07 ) Charlie's Turning Point is the largest conservative youth organization in the entire country. He forged a personal bond with countless young conservatives. He fought for free speech, religious liberty, strong borders, and a very strong and proud America. In everything he did, he put America first. He really put America first. And ultimately, Charlie became more than a leader of an important organization. He became the leader of historic movements all over the country, the movements, individual movements, one movement, but it was historic. Everything he did was historic, and a true evangelist for the cause of freedom, and the word of Almighty God.

( 40:52 ) God was very important to Charlie. He would say, "If you don't have religion, you're not going to have a strong country." It's true. He was so wise beyond his years. I talk to him sometimes. I'd say, "This guy is like a young guy." He was really a wise man. From the time Charlie worked on my presidential campaign in 2016, and he was there right from the beginning. He liked me, I don't know. I have no idea why. What the hell was he thinking? He said, "You're going to win, sir." I said, "You know, I'm running against 17 senators and a lot of tough people and governors. We have all these people." And he said, "No, you're going to win, sir." He said, "Not going to be close." And he made it happen. He helped make it happen. I'll tell you that. Without him, who knows what would be. Maybe you'd have Kamala standing here today. That would not be good. I will tell you, Javier, you don't know who Kamala is. Promise, it would not be good. Do you agree with that, Howard?

( 41:51 ) He also mobilized countless citizens to go vote. It's called Go Vote. Very simple. And with his help in 2024, we won more young people than any Republican by far in the history of our country, and we won the popular vote. We won seven of them. Remember, they said, "Oh, well, if Trump could win four, that would be nice." I win seven by a lot, by a landslide. But the popular vote was massive and we won the electoral college. Remember, it's going to be very hard. I'd say 270. Well, we got 312 to 226.

( 42:28 ) And then we won something called districts and councils and different things, but in one case, we won 2,750 to 525. That's the one where you see the map is almost entirely red, except they have a little blue line on one side and a little blue line, meaning New York and Los Angeles. I have a feeling that if the vote were 100%, we would've won that too. You want to know the truth? But he knew and he knew very well, and he also understood honesty. And he was always concerned with honesty.

( 43:03 ) The only way we can lose is if the cheating gets so bad, and that's where we came up with a little phrase, too big to rig. We said out and vote, just out and vote. And we had that. Remember, we used to say that all the time because people would say, "Oh, they're going to win. We don't have to vote. Let's go to a movie. We'll come home and watch later." And he wasn't about that. Really together, we came up with that phrase. We got to make it too big. I never made a speech where I didn't say at the end.

( 43:32 ) Now look, the polls are showing good. Don't believe the polls. He said, "We're going to make it Suzy, right? Too big to rig. So if you think we're going to win by a lot, doesn't matter. Pretend we're losing. You got to go out and vote." They voted. And at 9:02, the whole thing was over, right? 9:02. Remember they said, "Oh, this could go a few days?" Well, it went a few minutes, 9:02, and he knew that and I felt it, but he knew it. He knew it. I think he knew it more than anybody, but Charlie never missed an opportunity to remind us of the Judeo-Christian principles of our nation's founding or to share his deep Christian faith in his final moments. Charlie testified to the greatness of America and to the glory of our savior, with whom he now rests in heaven and he is going to make heaven.

( 44:22 ) I said, "I'm not sure I can make it, but he's going to make it." He's there. He's looking down on us right now. It's so incredible. Look at this, how this turned out. This was supposed to be so dark and cloudy. Not dark and cloudy, is it? Look at that. How beautiful that is. There's no artist that can capture it as beautiful as it is today. Wow. It's amazing.

( 44:46 ) As I said on the day that he was assassinated, Charlie Kirk was a martyr for truth and for freedom. And from Socrates to think and to Saint Peter, from Abraham Lincoln to Martin Luther King, those who changed history the most, and he really did have always risked their lives for causes they were put on Earth to defend. He was put on Earth to do exactly what he was doing. He didn't want to waste time. He would've been a top student at any college in the country.

( 45:19 ) I know the college as well. He's smarter than the guys. He was so smart, but he almost, I guess, didn't have the time. He knew what he wanted to do. It wasn't like, "Gee, I want to sit in the classroom for four years listening to people teach me liberal principles," because they were never going to teach him that anyway, but he didn't have the time. He really didn't have the time.

( 45:38 ) But every time the enemies of goodness and virtue tried to silence the voice of righteous and noble leaders like Charlie, they fail. They seem to fail. Ultimately, they look like they're doing well, and then they end up failing because the truth has been unrelenting over the years, over history. And people like Charlie, it's just they've got a power that others don't have, and very few people will ever have.

( 46:05 ) So today, like those martyrs before him, Charlie's voice, his message and his legacy are stronger and greater than ever before. They are greater than ever before. Look, this is a horrible event, but it brought out the greatness of Charlie. Nothing could have ever supplanted this. It's incredible the way people are talking about him and with great love.

( 46:32 ) I mean, I read so many stories about some of the enemies, but I watched the enemies, and it's hard for them to speak badly about them because they just don't. And then you do have people in the days since Charlie's killing, we've seen exactly why our country so dearly needed his example. We've watched legions of far-left radicals resort to desperate acts of violence and terror because they know that their ideas and arguments are persuading no one. They know that they're failing. They have the devil's ideology, and they're failing, and they know it. They feel it, and they become violent.

( 47:11 ) They seem to become very violent on the left. They've rammed vehicles into federal law enforcement, fired sniper rifles at ICE agents, and me. I made a turn at a good time. I made a turn at a good time. I turned to the right. Charlie couldn't believe it actually. He said, "How the hell did you make that turn?" I said, "I don't know." But fired rifles and threatened the lives of our Supreme Court justices, our great justices. They have to be protected. We just issued a lot of money, $60 million to protect the Supreme Court justices. Very important. We can't let anything happen. In places of worship, we're protecting our people. We've

Donald Trump ( 48:00 ):

We've seen that a candidate for Attorney General in Virginia boasted that he would want to see the Republican legislature, a legislator in Virginia shot in the head and to see his children murdered. He actually said this. And now he continues to run for office, and most people continue to back him, but he said he wants this man shot. He said shot in the head and to see his children murdered, and they keep running. Pretty amazing, right? That's a bad one. Let's see how that turns out, but that's a really bad one. Nobody's heard that one before. Especially in the wake of Charlie's assassination, our country must have absolutely no tolerance for this radical left violence, extremism, and terror. We're done with the angry mobs, and we're not going to let our cities be unsafe. We're going to make sure our cities are safe.

( 48:53 ) When you have Chicago where they had 4,000 people murdered over a very short period of time, 4,000 people. And then we have a governor stand up and say, "Oh, things are going swimmingly." No, they're not. We're going to make Chicago safe just like we're going to make, look what we did in D.C. It's so nice that we started here because this was one of the most violent places in the United States. It'd be dangerous to be right out here, but you couldn't go to a restaurant. The restaurants were all dying. The whole place was dying. You'd have these gorgeous, look at the Washington Monument over there, you'd have these gorgeous buildings and monuments and structures, and people were afraid to leave their apartment. They were afraid to go to work. They'd get into an Uber, and they'd feel safe, and then the Uber would be attacked. They thought they made safety, and then the Uber was attacked on the trip in.

( 49:46 ) But we've done a great job and now it's considered a totally safe city. We haven't had problems. Took us 12 days to make it great. We took out, Pam, 1700 hard criminals, career criminals in many cases, but these are hardened criminals. Many of them came in through the Biden open borders. We brought them back to the countries and a couple were so violent that we put them in jail. We don't want to take a chance that they could get back in because no matter how good we do, somebody can sneak in. They were so violent and so bad. One arrested 28 times. Every time he left prison, he'd get into a violent incident, 28 times, and we put him away for a long time.

( 50:27 ) But we're done with the angry mobs. We're done with it. This is such an unbelievable place right now. You take a look where you can walk down the middle of the street with your wife or your husband. Your children can walk. They could walk alone. It doesn't matter. They can walk anywhere in Washington, and they're safe now. If this were a year and a half ago, a year ago, they'd have a serious chance of being badly hurt, even killed, even killed. They'd come in from Indiana, they'd come in from Iowa, they'd come from Florida to see the nation's capital, and somebody would have to call the parents. "I'm sorry, but your son or your daughter has been killed." Not anymore.

( 51:08 ) You hear those sirens going off? That's good. That's a good sound. That means they either got the bad guy, or they're going to stop the bad guy. You didn't hear that sound because nobody wanted to do anything. Listen to the beauty of that sound. Seriously. And that's the real deal sirens. They're not politically correct sirens. You hear they're about three miles away. That's great. What a beautiful sound. They're stopping crime. That's what they're doing.

( 51:37 ) So we're done with the voices of fools, they're fools, and death threats, and we're going to make our cities safe. And I thought it was Charlie's, one of his biggest dreams was that, he couldn't believe it, Chicago's going to be a great city again. We sent people in there six months ago, and this governor said, "Well, crime is down." Yeah, that's because we had the FBI in there for six months just preparing it for the bigger surge. And they've done a great job, Kash and the FBI, they've done a great job and they loved doing it. They loved being able to do it. They were restricted from doing it. They couldn't do anything. And now they're totally unrestricted. All they have to do is stop crime, and they're doing it.

( 52:23 ) By the way, Memphis, as you know, you heard, they went in about a week ago, one of the most dangerous places in the country, really in the world, it's not just the country. They have very few cities that would compare to some of these cities. You go to Afghanistan, you say, "Oh, that's unsafe." Well, the crime numbers are much better than the crime numbers in places that we have. So Memphis, I understand is doing unbelievably. In one week it's like a different place. And this took 12 days. And then after that, we just perfected it. But after 12 days, we had good safety here. After one month, it's really amazing. And by the way, restaurants are booming. Restaurants are opening up. The big problem you have, you can't get into a restaurant in D.C. anymore. So they're opening up. It's a beautiful thing to see. It's called safety. It's called law enforcement and letting them do their job. That's why I said last month that I have directed the Attorney General and the Department of Homeland Security to confront the very real threat of left-wing terrorism in our country. It's a real threat, not when you confront it it's not because they're not brave people. In fact, they're cowards. When you confront them, they immediately fold. You have to see them fold. You have to see them crying. They fold, but it includes dismantling the networks that fund them and finance them. And we're finding out who those networks are. We already know quite a few of them.

( 53:54 ) When you see these violent incidents and then you see people holding this gorgeous sign with beautiful wood, beautiful cardboard, wood, everything, everything's perfect, perfect paint job, and they're all the same, there are thousands of them, you know that they weren't made in the basement out of love, they were made by anarchists and in some cases wealthy. I'll probably find some of my nice friends that are up there being so nice to me, especially lately they're being very nice, but it surprises you who they may be and you almost wonder why, why, why would they do it? But they're hurting our country and we're really taking it back one by one.

( 54:38 ) If we didn't go into Los Angeles early on in the administration, the Commissioner, the Chief of Police Los Angeles said, "If they didn't go in, we would've lost our city." Now they already lost 25,000 houses to fire because they wouldn't let the water come in from the Pacific Northwest, which they should have done. And I said, "You better do it." They didn't do it. And we had 25,000 homes where they had no water in their sprinklers. They had no water in their fire hydrants. It would've been a different kind of a thing if they did what they were supposed to do. We had to break in. We broke in and had the water come down. They said for the environment, it's great. They lost 25,000 houses. It's incredible. But the Commissioner said, "Without the federal government and President Trump's intervention, we would've lost the entire city."

( 55:26 ) And we have the Olympics going there soon. I got the Olympics. We have the Olympics, we have the World Cup, and most importantly, we have the 250th anniversary of our country that's going to be most important. And all of these things are happening, and we're going to have safe cities. We're going to have very, very safe cities.

( 55:43 ) So one month after Charlie's death, we still feel the terrible shock and the pain of his loss like just about nobody I can think of. Charlie Kirk was one of a kind. He was unstoppable and he really was, boy, when he had an idea in his head, oh, he would call me, "Sir, please, you haven't done it yet." I said, "Charlie, relax. Just relax." He didn't relax. He'd called me the next day again, got it done, but he was indomitable and always will be. He's really irreplaceable. Nobody can replace him, but they're going to do great. But you can't replace that kind of person and that kind of talent frankly. The word talent is an important word, but that kind of talent.

( 56:29 ) So we hold his memory in our hearts forever. Every single day of this administration, we will continue to carry out the mission for which he lived and he really did. He lived for this country, lived for his wife and his family, but he lived for this country too. In Charlie's honor, we will continue like we have been to fight, fight, fight, and to win, win, win. We're going to win so much.

( 56:58 ) So the Presidential Medal of Freedom is a big deal. You have the Congressional Medal of Honor, Military, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is civilian, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom is a really big deal. Very few people get it. Very few people frankly qualify. It's a decision of the President, but it's a qualification that's a very hard one to get, and I would like to ask, if I might, the military aide to read Charles James Kirk's citation for the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Speaker 15 ( 58:00 ):

The Presidential Medal of Freedom is awarded to Charles James Kirk. Accepting on behalf of Charlie is his wife, Mrs. Erika Kirk. Charlie Kirk was one of the most influential American political figures of his generation. At just 18 years old, he founded Turning Point USA and grew it into the largest conservative youth organization in the nation. For over a decade, he tirelessly traveled the country leading a movement to restore respect for our founding principles, reawaken our national identity, and inspire a renewed spirit of religious devotion. He was one of the great debaters and communicators of his time. Despite receiving repeated threats, he remained undeterred and modeled courage, logic, humor, and grace to the next generation.

( 58:55 ) On September 10, 2025, at age 31, Charlie Kirk was assassinated while addressing a group of students. The United States honors him of a martyr for truth and freedom.

Thank you, Mr. President, for honoring my husband in such a profound and meaningful way, and thank you for making this event a priority amid the peace process in the Middle East. Thank you. Very grateful.

( 01:00:36 ) Excuse me. Charlie always admired your commitment to freedom, and that's something that both of you shared. So thank you. Your support of our family and the work that Charlie devoted his life to will be something I cherish forever. So thank you.

Donald Trump ( 01:00:58 ):

Thank you.

Erika Kirk ( 01:01:00 ):

To our gracious First Lady and her office for making this event possible, thank you as well. It's beautiful. To Vice President and the lovely Usha Vance, your friendship has been an unbelievable encouragement. Thank you.

( 01:01:20 ) And to all our friends and family that are here and watching from all around the world, thank you for loving us. Thank you for praying for us and for believing in what Charlie believed in.

( 01:01:35 ) And to our Turning Point USA staff and the Charlie Kirk Show staff, we love you more than you could ever know. And to the Turning Point USA chapters that are watching all across America right now, you are the heartbeat of this future and of this movement. Everything that Charlie built, you guys are the legacy holders of that. You are living proof that his mission did not die with him. It lives through you. And Charlie always said, "The next generation will decide whether freedom endures." And because of you, I know that freedom will endure. It will.

( 01:02:24 ) And today we're gathered not only to celebrate Charlie's birthday, but to honor a truth that he gave his entire life to defend, and that's freedom. The very existence of the Presidential Medal of Freedom reminds us that the national interests of the United States has always been freedom. Our founders etched it into the preamble of our Constitution, and those words are relics on parchment. They're a living covenant. The blessings of liberty are not man's invention, they're God's endowment. Charlie lived for those blessings, not as abstract words, but as sacred promises.

( 01:03:12 ) He used to love to journal about this topic all the time and with such a heart postured of gratitude. And he believed that liberty was both a right and a responsibility. And he used to say, "Freedom is the ability to do what is right without fear." And that's how he lived. He was free from fear, he was free from compromise, free from anything that could enslave his soul.

( 01:03:47 ) His name Charles literally means free man. And that's exactly who my husband was. He was a free man. And from the time I met him, sitting across from him being interviewed on politics and philosophy and theology, anything that Charlie loved, any topic he loved, and I just saw the fire in his soul, and there was this divine restlessness within him that came from knowing God placed him on this earth to protect something very, very sacred for all of us, and he never stopped fighting for people to experience freedom. He didn't.

( 01:04:35 ) Charlie often said that without God, freedom becomes chaos. And he believed liberty could only survive when anchored to truth. And I remember in one of his speeches, he told the audience that the opposite of liberty isn't law. He said it's captivity and that the freest people in the world are those whose hearts belong to Christ. But what's so powerful is that Charlie had the ability to communicate so brilliantly across all generations, and he reminded us that in a world that tells us freedom is doing whatever you want to do, the real freedom is the power to live freely and to do what is right. And in one of his journal entries, he wrote that he wanted everyone to know that you can't have liberty without moral responsibility. Freedom divorced from faith eventually just destroys itself.

( 01:05:45 ) And what's so fascinating about all of this is looking back these past twelve years of Turning Point USA and his mission, there's almost this veil of sacredness because what I realized is that while he was building an organization, he was also building a movement, one that called people back to God, back to truth, and a movement that was filled with courage.

( 01:06:18 ) And ironically, for a man who impacted millions, Charlie never desired to be the center of attention. He just wasn't. My husband was not a man of extravagance. He loved simple but deeply meaningful things. Truly. He loved his late night walks. He loved buying more books than he could ever read because he felt there was no such thing as a book budget. And he loved being able to read to our kids the same bedtime story on repeat because he knew it was their favorite. But to him, that was special. And he loved to sit in the sun on a Saturday morning with his cup of decaf coffee and his phone was off because he was honoring the Sabbath. And for him, it was that moment to catch his breath and just be in peace because he was unreachable at the moment.

( 01:07:17 ) And he preferred quiet birthdays. But that never stopped me from telling him, I told him every single year, I said, "Baby, I love your birthday." I said, "Because it's the day that God knew the world couldn't go another day without you." And so the rhythm of our usual birthday celebration for him was mint chocolate chip ice cream, he only had it twice a year on his birthday and 4th of July, and then after that, he was back to work as usual. But last year, his one birthday wish was to see the Oregon Ducks play the Ohio State. And they won, Oregon won that night, and it was by far one of the most memorable nights of his birthday experience of his life until today.

( 01:08:14 ) And so honestly, President Trump, I have spent seven and a half years trying to find the perfect birthday gift for Charlie. And it's so difficult. And those of you that have spouses or loved ones, you know how difficult it is sometimes to buy a gift for someone that you love because he wasn't a materialistic man so that also did not help. But now I can say with confidence, Mr. President, that you have given him the best birthday gift he could ever have.

Donald Trump ( 01:08:43 ):

Thank you, Erika.

Erika Kirk ( 01:08:53 ):

It's such an honor. And the recognition of a life lived for defending freedom. And that's what Charlie fought for until his last breath. And it was written across his chest in those final moments on one of his simple T-shirts that always carried a message, and this one bearing a single word, freedom. That was the banner over his life, and that shirt was a declaration, the same declaration he made in every speech, every campus visit, every time he shared the gospel at a church, every sleepless night that he would spend praying for the youth of this nation and planning for the future of our country and just impressing upon them that when we defend liberty, we defend the soul of our nation.

( 01:09:47 ) My husband never told anyone what to say. He never did. He never told anyone what to say. He would just encourage them to think. He would encourage them to think outside of the traditional political labels. He would want them to think in a way that was anchored in wisdom and truth, but he would never tell anyone what to say.

( 01:10:12 ) Charlie wasn't content to simply admire freedom, he wanted to multiply it. He wanted to multiply freedom. He wanted young people to taste it and to understand it and defend it. He wanted them to see that liberty isn't indulgence, it's self- governance under God. He wanted them to see that.

( 01:10:36 ) And every day I'd see him getting ready for work. He'd put on his cross necklace, he'd put his ring on his finger, and the boldness in his demeanor was always fearlessness. He wasn't afraid. He was never afraid. In his daily actions, whether in office or on campus or at a church, it was always without fear. That was his creed. That is how he lived out every single day. He didn't fear being slandered. He did not. He didn't fear losing friends, I can tell you that. He didn't. He didn't care. He stood for truth and stood for freedom and everything else was just noise to him. And it's because his confidence in Christ was absolute. That's why.

( 01:11:24 ) There was no limit, no limit to what he would've sacrificed to defend freedom for all. And if the moment had come, he probably would've run for president, but not out of ambition. He would only have done it if that was something that he believed that his country needed from a servant's heart standpoint. And Charlie lived only 31 short years, now he's 32, but on this side of heaven. But he lived. He lived. Every single second he lived. He

Erika Kirk ( 01:12:00 ):

He filled every single day with purpose, and he fought for truth when it was unpopular. And he stood for God when it was costly, but that's what we're called to do. Surprisingly enough, he did pray for his enemies, which is very hard, but he did. He did. He did. No one else. I saw him do it.

( 01:12:25 ) No, he never did it in front of anyone else, but I can attest to that. But he also loved people when it was inconvenient, and he ran his race with endurance and he kept the faith. And now he wears the crown of a righteous martyr. And for me and for our children, the truth really studies our grief because heaven gained what earth could no longer contain.

( 01:12:54 ) A free man made fully free. To all watching, this is not a ceremony, this is a commissioning, and my message is simple. I want you to be the embodiment of this medal. I do. I want you to free yourself from fear. I want you to stand courageously in the truth. Listen for the still small voice of God, and remember that while freedom is inherited in this country, each of us must be intentional stewards every single day.

( 01:13:39 ) God began a mighty work through my husband and I intend to see it through, and the torch is in our hands now. It's in mine, it's in yours, it's in all of yours. It's in all the students with Turning Point USA. And before I close, I'll share with you that I asked our daughter what she would like to say to Daddy for his birthday. Excuse me. She said, "Happy birthday, Daddy. I want to give you a stuffed animal. I want you to eat a cupcake with ice cream, and I want you to go have a birthday surprise. I love you."

( 01:14:37 ) That's what she said. And while our son is precious, he can't yet speak. In classic Kirk family fashion, his actions spoke louder than his words and his gift to you, Charlie and myself, for that matter, was deciding to become the man of the house and be fully potty-trained at 16 months. But Charlie baby, I know that you're celebrating in heaven today, but gosh, I miss you. We miss you and we love you, and we promise we'll make you proud. And Charlie's life was proof that freedom is not a theory, it's a testimony.

( 01:15:19 ) He showed us that liberty begins not in the halls of power, but in the man of a heart surrendered to God. And so today, as we honor Charlie with this incredible Presidential Medal of Freedom on his birthday, I stand here with tears and just a humbled heart and spirit because his story reminds us all that to live free is the greatest gift, but to die free is the greatest victory. Happy birthday, my Charlie. Happy Freedom Day. I miss you.
