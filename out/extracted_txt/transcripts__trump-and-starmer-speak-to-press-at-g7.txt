UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 00:06 ):

Yes, sir.

Speaker 2 ( 00:07 ):

Pull camera. Pull camera.

President Donald J. Trump ( 00:16 ):

Okay. Thank you very much. We all know the great Prime Minister of the UK, and we just signed a document. This is… Whoop. Sorry about that.

UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 00:25 ):

A very important document.

President Donald J. Trump ( 00:33 ):

A little windy out here. Give me that. We just signed it and it's done. And so, we have our trade agreement with the European Union. And it's a fair deal for both, and it produces a lot of jobs, a lot of income, and we have many, many other ones coming. But you see the level of enthusiasm is very good. But the relationship that we have is fantastic, so I just want to congratulate you.

UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 01:00 ):

Well, Donald, thank you very much. This now implements on car tariffs and aerospace, and a really important agreement. And so, this is a very good day for both of our countries, a real sign of strength. So thank you again, Donald, a really important day for both of us.

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:15 ):

Great people, great people.

Speaker 2 ( 01:16 ):

Has anyone exchanged in any agreement since you spoke on the phone from the Oval Office?

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:25 ):

Not much. This is it.

UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 01:25 ):

This is implemented.

Speaker 4 ( 01:25 ):

Which deal is it? Was this deal made today?

Speaker 5 ( 01:25 ):

Mr. President, may I ask you a question please? Do you sir, believe there's accordance of deescalation of Israel and Iran, but you are the key to unlocking that.

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:34 ):

That's right. And here I am.

Speaker 5 ( 01:35 ):

And here you are.

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:36 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 5 ( 01:36 ):

So can I ask you, sir, have you spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu? When might you speak to him?

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:44 ):

I've spoken to everybody.

Speaker 6 ( 01:45 ):

What will you say?

President Donald J. Trump ( 01:46 ):

Israel is very, very well, as you probably noticed. And I gave Iran 60 days, and they said no. And the 61st, you saw what happened, day 61. So I'm in constant touch. And as I've been saying, I think a deal will be signed or something will happen, but a deal will be signed. And I think Iran is foolish not to sign one.

Speaker 2 ( 02:15 ):

Mr. President, Iran is accusing Netanyahu of attacking them to deliberately derail your nuclear plan that you had. What do you say to that? Do you think that's true?

President Donald J. Trump ( 02:26 ):

No, no. Look, Iran should have signed the deal.

Speaker 2 ( 02:28 ):

If it would help bring Iran to the negotiating table, would you guarantee that the US would not get involved militarily?

President Donald J. Trump ( 02:33 ):

Well, I think this. I think Iran basically is at the negotiating table. They want to make a deal. And as soon as I leave here, we're going to be doing something. But I have to leave here. I have this commitment. I have a lot of commitments. I have a commitment to a lot of countries, including the UK where we just signed our deal.

Speaker 6 ( 02:57 ):

Mr. President, about the Ukraine, Mr. President, when will-

Speaker 7 ( 02:57 ):

Mr. President, where are you settling on steel? Is that going to zero or are they staying-

President Donald J. Trump ( 02:58 ):

We're going to let you have that information in a little while.

Speaker 6 ( 03:03 ):

On Russia/Ukraine… On US/Russia talks, when will they start?

President Donald J. Trump ( 03:05 ):

They're starting already.

Speaker 6 ( 03:05 ):

Today?

Speaker 8 ( 03:07 ):

Mr. President, do you agree to the Europeans pose to apply more sanctions on Russia. Does the US support that?

President Donald J. Trump ( 03:15 ):

Well, Europe is saying that, but they haven't done it yet. Let's see them do it first.

Speaker 2 ( 03:19 ):

You told me earlier that you could sanction Russia. Why wait? Why wait to sanction them?

President Donald J. Trump ( 03:24 ):

Because I'm waiting to see whether or not a deal is there.

Speaker 9 ( 03:27 ):

Can you guarantee the UK won't be suffering?

President Donald J. Trump ( 03:28 ):

You forget. Sanctions cost us a lot of money. When I sanction a country, that costs the US a lot of money, a tremendous amount of money. It's not just let's sign a document. You're talking about billions and billions of dollars. Sanctions are not that easy. It's not just a one-way street.

Speaker 2 ( 03:45 ):

And just quickly, do you think that Israel can-

Speaker 10 ( 03:51 ):

Mr. President, on the AUKUS submarine agreement, is that still proceeding? If you can sort of give a view of that.

UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 03:53 ):

Yep. We're proceeding with that. It's a really important deal to both of us. I think the President is doing a review. We did a review when we came into it, so that makes good sense to me. But it's a really important-

President Donald J. Trump ( 04:02 ):

We're very longtime partners and allies and friends, and we've become friends in a short period of time. He's slightly more liberal than I am, to put it mildly.

UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 04:11 ):

Well, we stand slightly on the left.

President Donald J. Trump ( 04:14 ):

For some reason, we get along.

UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 04:15 ):

We make it work.

Speaker 2 ( 04:16 ):

Mr. President, did you just say that Ukraine would get in the way of arming Israel?

Speaker 10 ( 04:21 ):

There's quite a few British soldiers who worry you side more with the Russians over deep end war. Can you reassure this-

President Donald J. Trump ( 04:28 ):

No, I don't, no, no. You know what I side on? Saving lives. I only care about saving lives. We have nothing to do with it except that Biden stupidly let us get into that mess and gave him $350 billion, $350 billion. And yet, despite that, you saw how we did in the Middle East. We took it $5.1 trillion. We have $15 trillion almost, looking around that number, going to be invested in the US. So the money is not the thing in this case. It's 5,000 young people are being killed every week in Russia, Ukraine. And if I can stop that, I'll be very happy. They're Ukrainian and they're Russian. So you could say, "what am I doing?" But I'd like to see if I could stop it.

Speaker 2 ( 05:10 ):

Do you think that Israel can fully eliminate the threat that Iran poses, this nuclear threat that they pose without the United States military help?

President Donald J. Trump ( 05:18 ):

Who said that?

Speaker 2 ( 05:18 ):

No. I'm asking if you believe they can without the help of the US?

President Donald J. Trump ( 05:21 ):

Well, it's irrelevant. Something's going to happen.

Speaker 2 ( 05:23 ):

Have you spoken to the-

Speaker 11 ( 05:23 ):

Mr. President, would you consider traveling to the Mid East as part of any talks if it would help broker a deal?

President Donald J. Trump ( 05:29 ):

Yeah. Yeah, but I think we're doing pretty well. We're talking.

Speaker 11 ( 05:31 ):

You don't think you-

President Donald J. Trump ( 05:32 ):

We have a thing called the telephone, so we're talking. But it's always better to talk in person.

Speaker 8 ( 05:38 ):

Mr. President, do you want to see regime change in Iran?

President Donald J. Trump ( 05:42 ):

I want to see no nuclear weapon in Iran. And we're well on our way to making sure that happens.

UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 05:50 ):

And we've had a discussion about that morning, in the G7, absolute clarity in relation to the nuclear program. We do not want to see it.

Speaker 6 ( 05:54 ):

Mr. President, you have a response-

Speaker 10 ( 05:59 ):

Mr. President, can you guarantee the UK will be protected from any future tariffs?

President Donald J. Trump ( 06:01 ):

What?

Speaker 10 ( 06:01 ):

Can you guarantee the UK will be protected from any future tariffs?

President Donald J. Trump ( 06:03 ):

The UK is very well-protected. You know why? Because I like them. That's why. That's their ultimate protection. Thank you very much. The Prime Minister has done a great job. I want to just tell that to the people of the United Kingdom. He's done a very, very good job. He's done what other people, they've been talking about this deal for six years/.

UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 06:22 ):

Six years.

President Donald J. Trump ( 06:23 ):

And he's done what they haven't been able to do, so he's done really a very good job.

Speaker 2 ( 06:30 ):

Do you have any response to Tucker Carlson criticizing you saying that you were complicit in the war?

President Donald J. Trump ( 06:32 ):

I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying. Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.

Speaker 2 ( 06:39 ):

And quickly-

President Donald J. Trump ( 06:39 ):

Thank you.

UK Prime Minster Keir Starmer ( 06:40 ):

Thank you.

Speaker 2 ( 06:40 ):

Have you spoken to Zelensky before your bi lapses?

Speaker 7 ( 06:40 ):

Any more trade deals to comment, Mr. President?

President Donald J. Trump ( 06:42 ):

Yeah, a lot of them.

Speaker 2 ( 06:43 ):

Japan?

President Donald J. Trump ( 06:44 ):

A lot of them. Good happened.

Speaker 2 ( 06:44 ):

Good happened?

Speaker 11 ( 06:45 ):

How did it go with the Japanese, sir?
