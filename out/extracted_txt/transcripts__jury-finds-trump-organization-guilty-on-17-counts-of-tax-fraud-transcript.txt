That is consequential. It underscores that in Manhattan, we have one standard of justice for all.

Trump was not charged, in the defense that he did not know, but prosecutors say he signed off on parts of the scheme, initially memos like this one that prosecutors believe were intended to cheat tax officials. Experts say the verdict could make his second bid for the presidency more challenging. Prosecutors saying in closing arguments that the former president was not blissfully ignorant.

( 00:58 ) Prosecutors said that for 15 years, executives at the Trump Org leaned on the company to evade income taxes on rent, private school tuition, and luxury cars, and unveiled tax returns that showed massive losses, including nearly a billion dollars in operating losses over a two-year period while Trump starred on reality TV and as he was campaigning for president.

( 01:23 ) A Trump Organization spokesperson reacted to the guilty verdict, saying, “The notion that a company could be held responsible for an employee’s actions to benefit themselves on their own personal tax returns is simply preposterous.”

We’ll certainly be appealing, of course.
