In the meantime, former President Donald Trump is liable for sexually assaulting writer E. Jean Carroll and defaming her by calling her a liar.

That is the verdict from a civil jury in Manhattan after just three hours of deliberations, and Trump must pay her $5 million in damages. Samantha Cortese here now with reaction from both sides, including an angry Donald Trump. Sam?

Sam ( 00:22 ):

In just three hours, nine New Yorkers decided the former president will have to pay his accuser millions. Mr. Trump did not show up to the courthouse. He did not testify. But tonight we are hearing from him in a video response. Trump says he didn’t expect to get a fair trial from a Clinton appointed judge.

Trump ( 00:41 ):

The whole thing is a scam, and it’s a shame and it’s a disgrace to our country.

Sam ( 00:47 ):

Former President Trump reacting to a federal ruling in New York City. The jury found Donald Trump’s sexually abused, but did not rape E. Jean Carroll in a department store dressing room 27 years ago. And they say he defamed her when she came forward with that information saying she was totally lying. Mr. Trump insists he is innocent.

Trump ( 01:08 ):

I have no idea who she is, where she came from. This is another scam. It’s a political witch hunt. And somehow we’re going to have to fight this stuff.

Sam ( 01:19 ):

The jury awarded Carol $5 million, 2 million for the unwanted sexual contact and 3 million for defamation. His legal team says they are ready to appeal.

Joe Tacopina ( 01:29 ):

… please, affirming his belief as many people are that he cannot get a fair trial in New York City based on the jury pool.

Carroll left the Manhattan Courthouse smiling today. She did not speak there, but released a statement saying in part, “I filed this lawsuit against Donald Trump to clear my name, and today the world finally knows the truth.” On Truth Social, former President Trump also reacted saying The verdict is a continuation of the greatest witch hunt of all time.

Trump ( 01:57 ):

We cannot let our country go into this abyss. This is disgraceful.

Sam ( 02:03 ):

But will this impact his third run for president?

Alison Triessl ( 02:05 ):

Many of his supporters don’t seem to care and the numbers indicate that he is the forerunner. However, at some point it may be just too much for voters, all of this baggage that he carries with him.

Sam ( 02:24 ):

Carroll also said this is a win for every woman who has suffered because she was not believed. She filed her lawsuit last November under a New York bill, which opened a look back window for sexual assault allegations with long expired statutes of limitation. The former president will continue his current campaign for President. Mike and Cher?
