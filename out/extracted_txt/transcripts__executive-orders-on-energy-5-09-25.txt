Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Crazy. Hey, Gary, hold that up. Brian, hold that up. You guys were great.

Will ( 00:14 ):

Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 00:16 ):

No sense. Just no sense. But in addition to that, you have a lot of workers that lose their job, right?

Brian ( 00:22 ):

Yes, sir. 300 workers-

Donald Trump ( 00:23 ):

Crazy.

Brian ( 00:23 ):

… saved because of you.

Donald Trump ( 00:25 ):

Good. Thank you. It's an honor. Here's the Golden Dome, by the way of your interest. Here's the Golden Dome. That'll save all your lives someday, maybe. Okay. Good. Thanks, Brian. You hold it up?

Brian ( 00:40 ):

Yes, sir.

Will ( 00:41 ):

Next, Mr. President, we have House Joint Resolution 24. This is the same basic idea, but this relates to walk-in coolers and freezers and other refrigeration devices. Again, last-minute Biden-era regulation that hits ordinary American's hardware.

Donald Trump ( 01:02 ):

What did they do?

Will ( 01:04 ):

They put in… Sorry.

Speaker 4 ( 01:04 ):

Increased the energy efficiency requirements for walk-in coolers and freezers and therefore putting in undue burden on businesses across the country. Everything from restaurants to pharmacies, hospitals were all-

Donald Trump ( 01:15 ):

To a point where it didn't work. In other words, they made the restrictions so strong that it didn't work.

Speaker 4 ( 01:19 ):

And it was going to cost them so much money to actually meet the energy efficiency standards, which didn't really save much money. So this is going to actually help our small businesses across the country, Mr. President.

Speaker 5 ( 01:36 ):

Many manufacturers would've had to close stop lines, shut down the entire lines of businesses. And I just want to say rescinding these, this was done days before, days before you took office. They pushed through these regulations. They didn't think about the cost to businesses. They didn't put American interest first. They didn't put American businesses first. I'm so grateful we finally have a President who's not only walking back these insane, burdensome regulations that are ultimately going to cost us Americans and American businesses, but that you are thinking about the next generation. And as we're leading into Mother's Day, some of us are trying to parent and serve this country at the same time. Thank you for welcoming my son who is 15 with his mother serving, watching what we're doing for him and the generations to come. You are making this country stronger for them. Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 02:27 ):

Thank you very much. Good luck. Take care of your mom. You want to hold that up too?

Speaker 4 ( 02:33 ):

Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 02:36 ):

That's a big one, isn't it? Common sense. It's all about common sense, right? Okay.

Will ( 02:44 ):

Next sir, this is House Joint Resolution 42. Again, this is a rescission of a Biden-era regulation, in this case relating to energy conservation standards for household appliances and certain consumer products.

Donald Trump ( 03:05 ):

That's a good one. I know who's over there. I know who did this. Explain that please.

Speaker 6 ( 03:12 ):

Sure. Look, this is helping fight inflation because the burden on appliance manufacturers is going to drive up the cost of them producing household products, which means that when you go buy a washer, dryer, any appliance, it was going to drive up the cost for consumers. It reduces consumer choice. But in the bottom line, we've been trying to fight inflation despite inflation. This helps takes the cost out of producing these products that Americans need every day. And when you think, when you add all this up, it's one regulation here, one regulation there. They always say it's de minimis, but when you add it all up, it costs a lot to American consumers. And this is fighting back-

Donald Trump ( 03:52 ):

And it's not as good.

Speaker 6 ( 03:52 ):

And it's not as good.

Donald Trump ( 03:53 ):

Not nearly as good, not nearly as efficient and more costly. Other than that, it's wonderful.

Speaker 6 ( 04:00 ):

Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 04:01 ):

Great job. Thank you very much. Fantastic. Okay.

Will ( 04:03 ):

And lastly, sir, we have House Joint Resolution 75. Again, this is a rescission of a Biden-era regulation, in this case relating to energy standards for commercial refrigerators, freezers and refrigerator freezers.

Donald Trump ( 04:19 ):

Do you have the sink one in here? The sinks and the shower heads?

Will ( 04:23 ):

We have an executive order on that coming for you later, sir. Yes, sir.

Donald Trump ( 04:26 ):

That's coming when?

Will ( 04:28 ):

Later this afternoon.

Donald Trump ( 04:29 ):

Okay. Good. You're going to be around later this afternoon? Good. Sinks and shower heads where you buy a home and you have a new shower head and you don't get any water, the water doesn't come out of the sink, the water comes out of nowhere. Water a shame. What a ridiculous waste. Okay. Let me do this. Come here. Who's responsible for this, Will?

Speaker 7 ( 04:55 ):

This is mine, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 04:57 ):

Oh, good man here.

Speaker 7 ( 04:57 ):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump ( 04:59 ):

Okay.

Speaker 7 ( 05:00 ):

Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 05:00 ):

You want to discuss that?

Speaker 7 ( 05:01 ):

Yes, sir. This was a government regulation that we have now repealed. Thank you very much, Mr. President. That now saves the American taxpayers [inaudible 00:05:11] ready to say the Texas taxpayer, them too, but the American taxpayer because who would've ultimately paid the price on a government mandate and the government regulation, the people of America. So you just saved American taxpayer money. So thank you very much.

Donald Trump ( 05:26 ):

That's fantastic. Thank you. It's great job. Okay. Any questions?

Speaker 8 ( 05:31 ):

Caroline said today that a 10% baseline tariff on all countries is here to stay even after the deals are done. Does that mean that countries offering zero tariffs won't get reciprocity?

Donald Trump ( 05:43 ):

You are going to always have a baseline. There could be an exception at some point, we'll see, somebody does something exceptional for us. It's always possible. But basically you have a baseline of a minimum of 10% and some of them will be much higher, 40%, 50%, 60%, as they've been doing to us over the years. We had a wonderful deal yesterday. We have four or five other deals coming immediately. We have many deals coming down the line and ultimately we're just signing the rest of them in. But we always have a baseline of 10%.

Speaker 8 ( 06:15 ):

And then specifically on the possibility of an increase in taxes on wealthier Americans. What do you say to conservative Republicans who argue that this is an increase on small business owners?

Donald Trump ( 06:28 ):

Well, what we're doing is we're actually, if we ever did that, it would only be… And from what I hear, people would love to do it. I would love to do it frankly. But what we'll do is that they'll go around saying, oh, this is so terrible. Would you do it? Is you're giving up something up top in order to make people in the middle income and the lower income brackets save more. So it's really a redistribution. And I'm willing to do it if they want. I would love to be able to give people in a lower bracket a big break by giving up some of what I have. But I'll tell you, a lot of people say don't do it because of the fact that you have the Bush statement about Read my lips. But he lost because of Ross Perot. He didn't lose because of that statement.

Speaker 8 ( 07:13 ):

And then on the salt tax-

Donald Trump ( 07:15 ):

But I don't think they're going to be doing it. But I actually think it's good politics to do it where richer people give up… And it's a very small, it's like a point, but they give it up to benefit people in lower income.

Speaker 8 ( 07:27 ):

And then on the salt tax credits, Mr. President, there are some Republicans who say, why is it that these 45 other states should be paying taxes to alleviate the tax burden of New York-

Donald Trump ( 07:42 ):

It's only because those states are behind, very badly behind. And those people were affected very badly. And the sad part is oftentimes they were affected badly because you had bad management in those states, like in California with Newsom and people. So you had some bad management. But that's being worked on now and they may do a piece one way or the other. It's a very complex issue, but I think it's being worked out. It has not been settled yet, but they'll settle it up pretty quickly.

Speaker 8 ( 08:15 ):

Are you considering-

Speaker 9 ( 08:15 ):

What parameters have you given to Scott Bessent on negotiating with China this weekend?

Donald Trump ( 08:20 ):

We have to make a great deal for America.

Speaker 9 ( 08:22 ):

Are you going to be disappointed if he comes back without a deal?

Donald Trump ( 08:25 ):

No, not at all because we already made a great deal. We're not doing business with China right now. We lost $1 trillion last year with China, one trillion. So if you're not going to do business with them, you're not going to lose $1 trillion. I want China to do great. I'm very friendly with President Xi. I have great respect for him and for China, but we can't continue to allow them to do what they did. When I was President, they paid hundreds of billions of Dollars in tariffs and taxes, and then Biden screwed it all up. What he did to this country between the border and between all of the other problems, the wars, everything, what he did to this country should never be forgotten. But one of the things he did is the trade was so bad and so unbalanced. I think we are going to come back with a fair deal for both China and us.

Speaker 9 ( 09:17 ):

Have you given Bessent a number of how low you're willing to go?

Donald Trump ( 09:24 ):

Yeah, I am.

Speaker 9 ( 09:24 ):

Share that number?

Donald Trump ( 09:24 ):

But I put out a number today, 80%. So we'll see how that all works.

Speaker 10 ( 09:29 ):

The U.S. Embassy in Kiev is warning right now about possible Russian significant attack on Kiev. What's your message for Putin?

Donald Trump ( 09:40 ):

I have a message for both parties, get this war ended. We're losing 5,000 soldiers a week, Russian and Ukrainian soldiers, and other people also by the way. And I say, get this stupid war finished. That's my message for both of them. Thank you very much. We'll see you later.

Speaker 11 ( 10:05 ):

Thank you, guys. Thank you. Right out though there. Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 10:05 ):

He just came in to say hello.

Speaker 12 ( 10:08 ):

[inaudible 00:10:09].

Donald Trump ( 10:08 ):

Almost nothing. He came in to say hello. He was very nice. And I think he came in to thank me, frankly, I would say the primary reason. But he was very nice. He's a nice man. But I think he actually came in to thank me.

Speaker 8 ( 10:22 ):

Is he complying with ice? You'd like to see?
