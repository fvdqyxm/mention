Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Thank you very much, it's a tremendous honor. I brought some of our compatriots along with us, they're going to do a beautiful job for you for the next four years. And it's really been something very special and I have to say, Time Magazine, getting this honor for the second time. I think I like it better this time, actually. But we did a good job, we had a great first term despite a lot of turmoil caused unnecessarily, but the media's tamed down a little bit. They're liking us much better now, I think. If they don't, we'll have to just take them on again and we don't want to do that. But I do want to thank Time Magazine. I've been on the cover many times. I don't know who has the record, but I can only probably talk well about 25% of the covers. 25% are great, the others I just sort of hide. But it's been an honor and every time it's an honor, I will tell you, and thank you very much for doing it. Thank the whole group at Time, really very professional people. Thank you very much.

( 01:09 ) And to Jeff and all of the people from the New York Stock Exchange, he knows how much I like it because many years ago I bought a building across the street. I wasn't going to buy it, then I said, "You know, it's right next to the New York Stock Exchange, I'm going to buy it." We've had great success, 40 Wall Street, we've had tremendous success with it. But you've really had success with the New York Stock Exchange, it's an incredible group of people. And Jeff, you have done an incredible job, you and your group, and what a beautiful speech you made. Thank you very much. That was some introduction of all of us, but we've gone up since the election.

( 01:44 ) I was just told by Scott, everybody said, "You have to pick Scott Besson, he has to be the one chosen for Treasury." Where is God? Let's see, he's around here someplace. He's around here. He told me we picked up $3 trillion since the election day. And I said, "Well, that's good, but what about before the election day?" He said, "We picked up some money there because they thought you were going to win." I said, "I like this guy, he's going to be my Treasury secretary."

( 02:17 ) But it's true, I think we're going to have a tremendous run. We have to straighten out some problems, some big problems in the world. When we left, we didn't have any of these problems. We didn't have Russia with Ukraine, we didn't have Israel October 7th, we didn't have the Afghanistan disaster. We didn't have inflation, we had no inflation. And we had a very strong economy and we're going to do that again, but I think we're going to even up it because now we have experience that we didn't have. Now I know everybody. When I first came in, we came down, Melania and I, a great first lady who's very popular, by the way.

( 02:51 ) She rang in the bell, she rang in the bell. But we came down and we're driving down Pennsylvania Avenue and it was so beautiful. I said, "I've never done this before." I didn't know anybody. I got to the Oval Office and I'm picking all these big positions and I didn't really know the people in Washington, but boy, did I get to learn fast. And now we do and I think we have an incredible staff behind me and others that aren't here. We're going to do a fantastic job. We're going to create the incentive theory again. In fact, I just announced yesterday, I didn't announce it for this reason, but anybody investing $1 billion or more gets a very expedited approval process, because you know the approvals, when people come into the country, it takes them in many cases, 14, 15, 16 years to get the approval.

( 03:41 ) Lee is around here someplace, he's in charge of the environment. And that's Lee Zeldin, who ran an incredible race for governor in New York, was a very, very successful guy. Before that, he was a great congressman and he's a fantastic lawyer. He's in charge of environmental and we'll try and push him as much as possible to get those permits very quickly, like a nuclear power plant, I would say a week would be enough time. What do you think, is that okay? We're going to get fast approvals and it's great that we have Lee and all of the people behind. They're all stars in their own way, but it is an honor. And this is a double because usually they don't coordinate the Men of the Year or the Person of the Year with the ringing of the bell. And brilliantly, you picked them both at the same time and you were all friends and you said, "Let's do it."

( 04:31 ) And it takes one trip, it doesn't take two trips, that's okay. We like to save, we like to be able to do it properly. But this is a special group. So many friends in the audience, too. John, great job you've done at ABC. I'm really proud of you and you've been so nice to me, otherwise I wouldn't actually acknowledge you at all. But you have been, that really is. It's a terrific job you've done. But again, I want to thank you. We're going down to ring the bell now and I could just say that the economy, I believe is going to be very strong. We do have to solve some problems. We have wars going on that we didn't have, we have a lot of things happening that we didn't have that would've never happened, that would've never happened.

( 05:09 ) But now they have happened and I want to get them solved. We have to get them solved because ultimately, the power of weaponry today is the biggest threat we have, in my opinion. It's not some of the other things that you read about, it's the power of weaponry. The weapons are so powerful, so devastating. And I rebuilt our military, I got to know every one of them, including nuclear weapons. I hated to do it, actually, I hated to do it, but we did some nuclear weapons that are so devastating it almost makes you very sad as you get them and as they come online. It makes you very sad because you know what the purpose of them is and you just hope to God that you never have to use them. Because if you do, the world will never be the same.

( 05:54 ) So we have to be very, very smart, we have to be very sharp. We have to be very special to do a job and I think we'll get it done. I think we're going to get a lot of people in the room. We've seen it. We were in France where President Macron did a fantastic job with the cathedral, an absolutely fantastic job of Notre Dame and it was beautiful. It was the opening and I just got back and it was something really beautiful and a lot of world leaders there. We had about 80 world leaders, different countries and they were all coming together. They all wanted to meet us and meet me as representative of the US and there was a lot of goodwill, but we're going to get some really tremendous goodwill. I was even thinking about inviting certain people to the inauguration and some people said, "Wow, that's a little risky, isn't it?"

( 06:43 ) And I said, "Maybe it is, we'll see. We'll see what happens." We like to take little chances, but that's not a bad chance. Here's a gentleman that's going to do a great job at HUD. Good luck, my friend, right? He's been my friend for a long time. Nice to see you. I haven't shaken his hand yet. Come on, congratulations. Really, you're going to be great. And Ben Carson is your biggest fan in the world, you know that. Ben has been with us for a long time and he's done a fantastic job. Thank you, good. So ladies and gentlemen, go on, we're going to put it straight. We're going to give tremendous incentive like no other country has. We're cutting your taxes, we're going to cut them very substantially.

( 07:28 ) We got them down to 21% from probably 42% or 44%, depending on where you are. And we got them down to 21, everyone said that was a miracle. Now we're getting them down to 15%, but only if you make your product here. Otherwise, you pay 21%, which is not bad, it's in the middle of the pack, but 15% brings you down to among the lower. And for those that are running the big companies, those great big beautiful companies, nobody's going to be leaving us. You're going to be coming back, you're going to be bringing it back to the United States. We are incentivizing everybody to come back to the United States. We want you back here. Car manufacturers, everybody.

( 08:08 ) And we have one product that nobody has really to the extent that we do, it's called oil and gas. There is no country in the world that has more, we're number one. I brought it to number one during my first term in terms of production. We're going to be number one plus. We'll do numbers that nobody will really see before. And when that happens, prices are going to start coming down because people can't afford their groceries and they're going to be affording their groceries very soon. I tell the story about a woman who, an old woman, no money, went to a grocery store, had three apples. She put them down on the counter and she looked and she saw the price and she said, "Would you excuse me?" And she walked one of the apples back to the refrigerator and came back to pay for the two apples and she left with two apples.

( 08:56 ) The woman at the counter said, "That was so sad." And when I heard about the story, I said, "That should never happen in America and it's not going to happen in America." We're going to do it right and we're going to take care of our people and we're going to do things that nobody ever thought even were possible. But we're going to have an economy, the likes of which nobody's ever seen before, and everybody's coming back to America. I saw that the other day at the cathedral. They're all saying, "We want to come back, we want to come back." And with a couple of changes done by Howard and Scott and some of the great people up here with me, we're going to bring them all back, they're all coming back. So thank you very much, this is a great honor. And ringing the bell will be fantastic. Go out and get them, with you all the way. Thank you very much, thank you.
