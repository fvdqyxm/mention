Music ( 00:00 ):

Back in black, I hit the sack.

( 00:00 ) I've been too long, I'm glad to be back.

( 00:00 ) Yes, I'm let loose from the noose.

( 00:00 ) That's kept me hanging about.

( 00:00 ) I'm just a looking at the sky because it's getting me high.

( 00:00 ) Forget the hearse, because I'll never die.

( 00:00 ) I got nine lives, cat's eyes.

( 00:00 ) Abusing every one of them and running wild.

( 00:00 ) Because I'm back.

( 00:00 ) Well, I'm back in black.

Recording ( 03:21 ):

In every moment, greatness awaits for the bold, the visionary, and those ready to take their shot. Here, we don't chase success, we define. The University of Alabama, where legends are made.

( 03:47 ) I think I've been waiting for this for three and a half years, and I think I finally get to live up to the epitome of where legends are made, and I'm super excited.

( 03:55 ) It's very exciting. Sad to leave, but very happy for all the experiences I've had over the past four years. It's such a different experience from every else. Honestly, here is one of the best spots for a culmination of everything. You have different people, the culture is just different than everyone else, and it's really just an exciting place to be.

( 04:12 ) My favorite thing, I guess would be my professors. They helped me out in my time here and they really took care of me. They're always there whenever I needed them.

( 04:21 ) The teachers are the best. I feel like I got the best education, so there's not any other reason I could tell you. You get the best education, plain and simple.

( 04:29 ) Here we go, three-point game in overtime. Mauro's got it. LSU's got to get a shot. Williams locked in.

( 04:50 ) Well, this could be the last time that the Alabama Crimson Tide play women's basketball at Coleman Coliseum this season. These final two games for the Crimson Tide are critical. I want to make three points today. I think the most important aspect, our players, our current players doing everything that we can every single day to invest in them with the highest level. It's in building that fan base and getting out and working hard in the community. They're going to be the team behind our team. Guys, there's a rich tradition here, and I'm proud to be a part of that.

( 05:20 ) We standing on vintage, hey. Hey, we on vintage.

( 05:23 ) Hey, there's an opportunity out front. Answer the call, do the call the right way. You rebound, you play hard and do it for 40 minutes. Let's go, play it for the Lord. Let's go.

( 05:32 ) [inaudible 00:05:36]. Repeat on three, 1, 2, 3.

( 05:56 ) [inaudible 00:05:57].

( 05:56 ) [inaudible 00:05:57] and gets it. That's a big bucket right there for Diana College [inaudible 00:06:03]. Yes, it's Cody knocks it down. Alabama [inaudible 00:06:03] with an exclamation point. Denied. Open three is good.

Music ( 06:03 ):

[inaudible 00:06:03] 20s and 10s [inaudible 00:06:03] give me a 10.

Recording ( 06:03 ):

Seconds remaining in this game. Eight second difference between the game clock and shot clock. Williams around the screen. Right elbow jumper is good. That ties the game at 79.

( 06:11 ) We want to take the last shot.

( 06:11 ) Where do you go with the basketball? Leoni's been your top scorer, but she's fouled out. Other scorers in this game, Sarah Ashley Barker. Back to Green, long range three is perfect. In 82:79 with 4:13 to go in overtime. By NASCAR. Here's Barker, driving, left side layup up and in. Crimson Tide back in front. 84/82. But Barker, Barker attacks [inaudible 00:06:40] spins. Puts it up, puts it in. Sarah Ashley Barker. To Barker. Barker against Johnson, block Foul called on Johnson, and that is her fifth foul. So Barker called for a foul after the review as well, so with that, that would be her fifth foul. Kristy Curry can't believe it, putting her hands on her face. Kristy Curry having to be held back by her assistant coaches as well as the players, and just fouled out with that intentional foul, Sarah Ashley Barker.

( 07:03 ) Five on the clock. Let's go. [Inaudible 00:07:08].

( 07:08 ) [inaudible 00:07:08] don't stop, regardless of what happens.

( 07:11 ) Shot clock at 10. It's Williams, guarded by Weathers. Cody comes out. Williams to the basket. Good defense by Alabama. They get the stuff. They've got possession, and Mauro gives the foul with 4.1 to go. Green's played big here tonight. The second, it's a three point game. Timeout, LSU. They will advance it to the front court with… Here we go. Three point game in overtime. Mauro's got it. LSU's got to get a shot. Williams launches [inaudible 00:07:46] and the Alabama Crimson Tide [inaudible 00:07:52] LSU.

Music ( 07:42 ):

I see trees of green.

Recording ( 07:42 ):

And this ballgame is over. [inaudible 00:07:58].

Music ( 12:00 ):

Red roses too.

( 12:00 ) I see them bloom for me and you.

( 12:00 ) And I think to myself.

( 12:00 ) What a wonderful world.

( 12:00 ) I see skies of blue and clouds of white.

( 12:00 ) The bright blessed day, the dark sacred nights.

( 12:00 ) And I think to myself.

( 12:00 ) What a wonderful world.

( 12:00 ) The colors of the rainbow.

( 12:00 ) So pretty in the sky.

( 12:00 ) Are also on the faces.

( 12:00 ) Of people going by.

( 12:00 ) I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"

Recording ( 12:38 ):

I actually wanted to be a doctor since I was four years old. My parents were also very supportive. Growing up, Dad was the one that really pushed me to challenge my academic initiative, but one main thing that he really valued was being able to really understand, and being able to teach it to others. He says, "If you can teach a concept, you know the concept." And my mother definitely pushed me to be emotionally competent, where I was really understanding other individuals. As a physician, you're not only caring about the well-being and the physiological aspects of a patient, another individual, but you're also molding and forming a meaningful and a genuine relationship. That's really the initiative and the why behind why I pursued a career in medicine. When applying the colleges, my senior year, one thing I wanted to really consider was, how can I be able to make impact while I'm here and make that story unique to myself.

( 13:26 ) So, actually, I have a family friend that went to Alabama. I'm from Northeast Tennessee. I realized that I was looking at more in-state schools. Once I realized that Alabama was an option, I went ahead and started reaching out to the office here. One major factor I wanted to consider was the opportunities to take on leadership roles. Of course, with the student organizations that we have and the multiple different offices on campus, there was many different areas where I can get involved in. That was something that I found very important, not only my academic interests, but my student involvement and community interest. From the beginning, I wouldn't say Alabama was on my radar, but looking back it was definitely worthwhile.

( 13:59 ) My first lab experience was here on campus, and I joined a project my freshman year, studying how traumatic brain injury actually affects the reward-signaling pathway in the brain. And we utilized fish as a model organism. After finishing that experience summer of my freshman year, I got the opportunity to take on my own project, studying how muscle physiology actually provides varying levels of behavior and performance abilities within fish. From there, I started looking at opportunities at other institutions. I did an internship at Harvard Medical School, studying how neurons in the brain actually play a role in how fast cancer cells can actually develop within the brain, and it was the experience of a lifetime, lead a independent project, be able to shadow physicians, network with medical students, faculty, 10 weeks just to really immerse myself in… [inaudible 00:14:45] I wound up, end up pursuing was definitely a great experience, and I got to really expand my network much further than I would've ever thought. And this summer I'm actually interning at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'll be learning how calcium signaling and biochemical pathways play a role in pancreatic cancer development.

( 15:02 ) If there is a research interest that you have, there is more than likely a profession on this campus that is doing that field of research or is connected to someone else that is doing that field of research. The university has the resources, the faculty, and of course the assistance that you'll need to really get involved in the research that you're interested in. My research has not only taken me to conferences on campus, I had the opportunity to go to national conferences, receive funding to go to those. So I've been able to go to Phoenix, Arizona for the first time, Seattle, places I never would've thought I would've been at, being able to get a combination of great academics, well-funded and well-accessible research, and infinite amount of extracurricular opportunities and involvement that you can really pursue what you want, but also be confident that you're doing the right amount of everything to ensure that you make it to the end goal, which is of course applying to med school and being admitted. The Iron Bowl, Auburn, traveling to Tuscaloosa, Alabama about an 11, 11 and a half point favorite. The total in the low 50s, around 52. This game's Saturday, 3:30 Eastern Time on ABC. The Crimson Tide have won four straight against the Auburn Tigers as their longest win streak against Auburn since winning nine in a row from 1973 to 1981.

( 16:27 ) Alabama versus Georgia really happened. Alabama versus LSU really happened. That's the good news. The bad news is, Alabama versus Vandy happened, Alabama versus Tennessee happened, Alabama versus Oklahoma happened. So, that's in the past. The future is the Iron Bowl. You barely escaped last year with a fourth and a mile, how do you fare this year?

( 16:48 ) This is college football rivalry, I think at its purest. It's all about this game. Playoff, no playoff, BCS, whatever you want to talk about, this game, to those fan bases, is everything and anything you care about, 365 days a year.

( 17:03 ) This game is really important to the people in the State of Alabama. When you're born in Alabama, you have a birthright. You're either going to be for Alabama or you're going to be for Auburn. You grow up that way with great passion. So, this is a big game to a lot of people, and it's a big game to the players.

( 17:17 ) [inaudible 00:17:22].

( 17:17 ) Jarquez Hunter stood up near the line of scrimmage. Tim Canaan in the middle of that Alabama defensive line, and it's a three and out for Auburn. [inaudible 00:18:00] got dumped by Qua Russaw.

( 18:04 ) Two wide outs left, two right. Thorne gets the snap, fires at right side, catch is made and dropped. Great hit delivered by Alabama. Oh, Malachi Moore, a big, big hit, knocking the football loose from Revaldo Fairweather. It's a 39 yard drive. Snap a little high, spot is down, kick is wide left. He hooked it, and Alabama turns away the Tigers. Jim Miller delivers a stiff arm and then gets knocked out of bounds with the first out. Fake to Jeremy Bernard. Milroe with some room outside. Milroe, touchdown.

( 18:49 ) He's the fastest quarterback they've seen since Michael Vick. At that time, auburn underestimates [inaudible 00:18:54], gets the edge, and scores the first touchdown of the game.

( 18:56 ) [inaudible 00:18:57] Williams. Auburn moves. Let's see if they throw a flag. They do. They have a free play, goes in the right side line, catches is made, Jeremy Bernard. That alone is enough for a first out, and [inaudible 00:19:08] took advantage of the freebee. [inaudible 00:19:09] Hunter, the running back, it's floated to Hunter on a huge hit by Malachi Moore. Short throw, [inaudible 00:19:20]. There's another throw to [inaudible 00:19:23]. Josh Cuevas. Milroe is under center. Milroe [inaudible 00:19:30] touchdown. [inaudible 00:19:37]. Understand the situation, stay within yourself. Okay, help each other out, communicate, don't take anything for granted, and finish, all right?

( 19:50 ) Yes, sir.

( 19:51 ) So Milroe will operate from the pistol. They'll swing it out to Ryan, trying to set up a screen. Makes one man miss, get to the 30, get to the 35, right? First down. Pick up for Alabama. Boy, action. Milroe fires at left side, gets into the hands of Bernard. Missed tackle. Fights forward. Gets the first down. Down to the 25 yard line. [inaudible 00:20:10] fakes to Ron Williams, and the little throwback to Dupree. You've Kayden Proctor and Tyler Booker out front, doing a excellent job of not getting a block in the back. Justice Haynes to the goal line, touchdown Alabama.

( 20:16 ) [inaudible 00:20:27] backfield, pressure coming, and he goes down. Tim Kayden III, getting the first sack of the game for Mammoth.

( 20:36 ) In six up coming, and off goes to Haynes. Justice fights his way forward. Quarterback Keith. And there goes the quarterback. Touchdown Alabama. Jalen Milroe, a 17-yard keeper, and the Tide adds to its lead, 27 to 6, with 6:54 to go. This is the double pass. Hunter fires into a crowd, intercepted, picked off by Bray Hubbard. The ball is out. It's an incomplete pass. Monty Jackson knocked it out. He goes down at the 30 yard line. Clock under three minutes now. Bray Hubbard making the stop. Tigers [inaudible 00:21:35] the pocket, [inaudible 00:21:39] squares his shoulders, throws downfield, hits, McDonnell, hits McDonnell, intercepted Alabama, intercepted right around the 38-yard line. [inaudible 00:21:52].

And some of you guys taught me how big that was, and I appreciate you guys for that. Seniors, proud of you guys. I'm happy for you. I love all of you in this room, and man, I'm just glad we got a chance to send you seniors off the way we did here today, with the last game here.

( 23:03 ) [inaudible 00:23:04].

( 23:03 ) Hey man, I love you all, boy. I know the season ain't going the way we want it, but the way we came out to finish, bro, that's a testament to who we are as people, or who we are as members of the Alabama Crimson Tide, man. We cut like no other, bro. We one to one. I don't know what the future holds, bro. Bro, I love all you all, bro. I don't want to go to war with anybody else.

Dr. Dalton ( 45:52 ):

Thank you Emily, you may be seated. Before we move forward, I'd like to take a moment to recognize a very special group in attendance. We are proud to have members of the armed forces as part of our UA community. Your commitment to duty and sacrifice for others embody the very values we hope all graduates carry with them as they leave this campus. Courage, service, and leadership.

Good evening.

Chad Tindol ( 47:17 ):

Roll Tide.

Speaker 10 ( 47:18 ):

Roll tide.

Chad Tindol ( 47:20 ):

That's much better. Faith is such an important part of the lives of so many of our students at the University of Alabama, and whether that faith is Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or another, commencement is an especially great time to reflect on that faith on our purpose and its meaning. I'm pleased to welcome to the podium Dr. Wade Langer of UA Campus Ministries who will offer tonight's invocation reflecting on this moment in our futures.

Dr. Wade Langer ( 47:59 ):

On this day of great celebration, we give thanks. Now, please pause with me for a moment of silent reflection and gratitude.

( 48:09 ) Almighty God, giver of life, source of knowledge, compassion and goodness. We are grateful for the ways you have blessed these graduates, for the friendships that have held them, for the instructors who have mentored them and for the lessons that expanded and shaped them the most. During their time here at the Capstone, we trust they have been prepared for their future and will rise to whatever challenges may await them. Through your gracious power on this day, pour out your love and wisdom upon them and bring the work started in these graduates to completion. Give them strength to pursue the dreams you've instilled in their hearts. Equip them with compassion, with integrity and fairness, humility and respect. Grant them courage to step boldly from the simplicity and security of college life into a world in need.

( 49:01 ) A world that aches for their gifts, their passion, their vision, and their hopeful idealism. Offer them humility in success, patience in uncertainty, hope in doubt, and peace in times of unrest. And as they go using all the gifts you've given them, send them forth from this campus to do all the good they can, by all the means they can, in all the ways they can, in all the places they can, at all the times they can, to all the people they can as long as they ever can to remind the world that the worst things in life don't have to be the last things that there is always, always a reason to hope.

( 49:42 ) So on this day, we entrust these graduates to you. They are no longer ours, but yours. Put them to what you will, place them with whom you will and in whatever they do, let them be employed by you to bring about a truly great tomorrow. In your name, Amen.

Chad Tindol ( 50:15 ):

Thank you, Dr. Langer for those words of hope. One of the greatest honors of working at the University of Alabama is witnessing the talent, determination and heart of our students. Whether they're joining us from Flomaton or Florida, Washington or the wiregrass, our students are truly the best and none has shone brighter than the class of 2025.

( 50:47 ) You have shown remarkable resilience, leadership, and pride in this university. You'll hear from a student who embodies all that and more tonight. It's my privilege to introduce the class of 2025 Student Government Association President, Samad Ghalani. Samad has been a strong voice for students and a reflection of what's possible when you lead with passion and purpose. Samad.

Samad Ghalani ( 51:21 ):

Good evening, everyone. To our families, friends, faculty, staff, and special guests, thank you for being here tonight to celebrate with us. Your support, encouragement, and care have brought us to this moment and we do not take that for granted. We are grateful to the President of the United States for joining us this evening and selecting the University of Alabama as part of this historic visit to recognize the hard work and potential of our graduating class. And especially to my fellow graduates, congratulations. This weekend we can truly say we made it. Commencement marks more than the end of our time at the University of Alabama. It marks the culmination of every step that brought us here from the first time we set foot on this campus to the night games in Bryant-Denny Stadium. The long hours in Gorgas, the victories, the challenges, and every moment in between that quietly shaped who we are today.

( 52:26 ) This class, our class has been through a lot. We've seen global uncertainty from a pandemic rapid change in circumstances that forced us to grow in ways that we never expected. But through it all, we didn't just adapt, we evolved. We grew into leaders, thinkers, creators, advocates and friends, and we didn't do it alone. As the 113th SGA president for the class of 2025, I've had the incredible privilege of watching your determination and resilience up close. I've watched students launch meaningful initiatives, advocate for their values, and extend a hand to help others rise. We each came to the University of Alabama from different walks of life, different hometowns, different stories, different dreams. The University of Alabama gave us the space to grow, to pursue our education and to find community within our diversity. I've seen steady leadership, quiet support, and moments when we came together, not because we had to, but because we wanted to.

( 53:43 ) I truly believe that this class represents what it means to lead with purpose. We've learned so much here, but maybe the most important thing is this. Leadership isn't about having the right title. It's about showing up, it's about listening. It's about being the kind of person who makes space for others to shine, and class of 2025, you have done that again and again and again. I also want to take a moment to recognize someone who has quietly shaped this experience for many of us. President Stuart Bell. Dr. Bell, your steady leadership, your humility, and your care for students have left a lasting mark on us all. Whether it be standing at this podium, visiting with students, or cheering us on from the sidelines, you have shown us what it looks like to lead with integrity. On behalf of all of us, thank you for believing in us, in our students, and for making UA a place where we have truly felt seen and supported.

( 54:55 ) As we turn the page this weekend, we do so knowing that our story is still being written and while it may feel like we're stepping into the unknown, I know we are more prepared than we realize from our time at the University of Alabama. We've learned to adapt, we've learned to lead. We've learned to care deeply and think critically. And now, we take that into the world, not just to build our own futures, but to help shape a better future for others. And as proud graduates of this wonderful institution, it is also our duty to give back. Whether we stay in Alabama or take what we've learned elsewhere, we carry a responsibility to be good stewards of our education, to lift others and to help ensure that the values we learned here ripple outwards.

( 55:45 ) So class of 2025, I challenge you. Wherever you go next, bring that fire, bring that curiosity, bring the pride that you feel tonight and let it carry you through whatever comes next. Because this isn't just the end of something great. It's the beginning of something even greater. Congratulations class of 2025. It's been an honor to walk this journey with you. Now, please turn your attention to the screens as we share a special senior tribute video honoring the class of 2025 and the friendships, memories, and milestones that have defined our time at the Capstone. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to go sit with my classmates for this one, and you know I can't end without one last Roll Tide.

Speaker 10 ( 56:32 ):

Roll Tide.

Speaker 3 ( 56:33 ):

The best way to describe my time here has been full circle. I think growing up as an Alabama fan with my parents going here and just coming to visit campus all the time, there's really been nothing more full circle than seeing how my experience here has taken shape, especially with all the opportunities I've been awarded here at UA. I couldn't think of any way to make it more perfect.

Speaker 4 ( 56:57 ):

Met the best people, had the most fulfilling college experience, both with school and outside of school. It's everything I could have asked for.

Speaker 5 ( 57:06 ):

I just feel like I've had such a wonderful four years. I've spent many, many Saturdays in this stadium, and so I figured what better way to say goodbye to my time here than in the place where I had the most fun.

Speaker 12 ( 57:16 ):

Best decision I ever made, man. Best four years I've had with these kids too, it's been fun.

Speaker 6 ( 57:21 ):

These four years really do go by so fast. It feels like yesterday we were moving into our freshman dorm together and now we're like three weeks out from graduation.

Speaker 11 ( 57:28 ):

You'll find your area, you'll find your friends. There's space for everybody here.

Speaker 7 ( 57:33 ):

The staff members that I have met, my co-workers, the faculty members, they all were very uplifting and supportive. In times I didn't believe in myself, they were there cheering me on. So I did say I found my cheerleaders everywhere throughout campus.

Speaker 5 ( 57:48 ):

The impact that the university has had, I would say is it taught me what it means to be a legend, but also a team player. And it taught me the importance of being present through your four years here and through any moment in your life.

Speaker 6 ( 58:00 ):

I'm going to miss living within a five-minute walk of all my best friends. I love how close this campus is and how close the [inaudible 00:58:06] community is and it's been amazing just being able to call my best friend down the street and say, "Hey, let's go for a walk on the quad," which is just so beautiful to walk down.

Speaker 5 ( 58:13 ):

I am going to miss the people. I'm going to miss seeing the same people every day for four years and really getting to hone in on those relationships. And I'm going to miss saying roll tide to someone and them saying it back.

Speaker 4 ( 58:24 ):

Wherever I go in the future, saying that I went to the University of Alabama. It's not just a place I attended school. Like I said, I feel like it's a culture that I'm now a part of.

Speaker 8 ( 58:34 ):

Roll Tide.

( 58:35 ) Roll Tide.

( 58:39 ) Roll Tide.

( 58:41 ) Roll Tide.

( 58:42 ) Roll Tide.

Speaker 7 ( 58:42 ):

Roll Tide.

Speaker 3 ( 58:42 ):

Roll tide.

Speaker 5 ( 58:42 ):

Roll tide, guys.

( 01:01:13 ) Come on, baby, don't say maybe.

( 01:01:19 ) I got to know if your sweet love is going to save me.

( 01:01:38 ) Oh, we got it easy.

( 01:01:45 ) We oughta take it easy.

( 01:01:45 ) You're everlasting summer you can see it fade in fast.

( 01:01:52 ) So you grab a piece of something that you think is going to last. Well you wouldn't even know a diamond if you held it in your hand.

( 01:02:38 ) The things you think are precious I can't understand.

( 01:02:48 ) Are you reeling in the years? Stowing away the time.

( 01:03:01 ) Are you gathering up the tears?

( 01:03:01 ) Have you had enough of mine?

( 01:03:01 ) Are you reeling in the years?

( 01:03:06 ) Stowing away the time.

( 01:03:06 ) Are you gathering up the tears?

( 01:03:06 ) Have you had enough of mine?

( 01:03:06 ) You've been telling me you're a genius since you were 17.

( 01:03:16 ) In all the time I've known you, I still don't know what you mean.

( 01:03:19 ) The weekend in the college didn't turn out like you planned.

( 01:03:23 ) The things that pass for knowledge I can't understand.

( 01:03:26 ) Are you reeling in the years? Stowing away the time.

( 01:03:33 ) Are you gathering up the tears?

( 01:03:37 ) Have you had enough of mine?

( 01:03:38 ) Are you reeling in the years?

( 01:03:44 ) Stowing away the time.

( 01:03:46 ) Are you gathering up

Recording ( 01:04:46 ):

I spend a lot of money, and I spent a lot of time.

( 01:04:55 ) The trip we made to Hollywood is etched upon my mind.

( 01:04:55 ) After all the things we've done and seen, you find another man.

( 01:04:55 ) The things you think are useless, I can't understand.

( 01:04:56 ) Are you reelin' in the years?

( 01:04:56 ) Stowin' away the time?

( 01:05:49 ) Hoo, hoo.

( 01:05:49 ) There here's a story 'bout Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue.

( 01:05:49 ) Two young lovers with nothing better to do.

( 01:05:49 ) Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube.

( 01:05:49 ) And here's what happened when they decided to cut loose.

( 01:05:49 ) They headed down to, ooh, old El Paso.

( 01:05:49 ) That's where they ran into a great big hassle.

( 01:05:49 ) Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle.

( 01:07:18 ) Bobbie Sue took the money and run.

( 01:07:19 ) Hoo, hoo, hoo.

( 01:17:45 ) Sent a letter on a long summer day.

( 01:17:45 ) Made of silver, not of clay.

( 01:17:45 ) Ooh, I've been runnin' down this dusty road.

( 01:17:45 ) Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) I don't know where I'll be tomorrow.

( 01:17:45 ) Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) I've been trying to make it home.

( 01:17:45 ) Got to make it before too long.

( 01:17:45 ) Ooh, I can't take this very much longer. No.

( 01:17:45 ) I'm standing in a sleet of rain.

( 01:17:45 ) Don't thing I'm ever gonna make it home again.

( 01:17:45 ) The morning sun is risin'.

( 01:17:45 ) It's kissin' the day.

( 01:17:45 ) The wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) I don't know where I'll be tomorrow.

( 01:17:45 ) Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) Whoa. My, my, my, my, my.

( 01:17:45 ) For tomorrow.

( 01:17:45 ) Oh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) I don't know where I'll be tomorrow.

( 01:17:45 ) Wheel in the sky keeps me yearnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) Ooh, I don't know. I don't know.

( 01:17:45 ) Oh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) Ooh, I don't know where I'll be tomorrow.

( 01:17:45 ) Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) Ooh, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.

( 01:17:45 ) Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) Don't know where I'll be tomorrow.

( 01:17:45 ) Ooh, the wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'.

( 01:17:45 ) … my wayward son.

( 01:17:45 ) There'll be peace when you are done.

( 01:17:45 ) Lay your weary head to rest.

( 01:18:22 ) Don't you cry no more.

( 01:18:22 ) Once I rose above the noise and confusion.

( 01:18:22 ) Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion.

( 01:18:22 ) I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high.

( 01:18:22 ) Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man.

( 01:18:22 ) Though my mind could think, I still was a madman.

( 01:18:22 ) I hear the voices when I'm dreaming.

( 01:18:22 ) I can hear them say.

( 01:18:22 ) Carry on, my wayward son.

( 01:18:22 ) There'll be peace when you are done.

( 01:18:22 ) Lay your weary head to rest.

( 01:18:22 ) Don't you cry no more.

( 01:18:22 ) Masquerading as a man with a reason.

( 01:18:22 ) My charade is the event of the season.

( 01:18:22 ) And if I claim to be a wise man, well, it surely means that that I don't know.

( 01:18:22 ) On a stormy sea of moving emotion.

( 01:18:22 ) Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean.

( 01:18:22 ) I set a course for winds of fortune.

( 01:18:22 ) But I hear the voices say.

( 01:18:22 ) Carry on, my wayward son.

( 01:18:22 ) There'll be peace when you are done.

( 01:18:22 ) Lay your weary head to rest.

( 01:18:22 ) Don't you cry no more. No.

( 01:18:22 ) Carry on.

( 01:18:22 ) You will always remember.

( 01:18:22 ) Carry on.

( 01:18:22 ) Nothing equals the splendor. Now your life's no longer empty.

( 01:19:39 ) Surely, heaven waits for you.

( 01:19:39 ) Carry on, my wayward son.

( 01:19:39 ) There'll be peace when you are done.

( 01:19:39 ) Lay your weary head to rest.

( 01:19:39 ) Don't you cry.

( 01:19:39 ) Don't you cry no more.

( 01:19:39 ) No more.

( 01:19:39 ) Here we stand.

( 01:19:39 ) Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two.

( 01:19:39 ) Sleepless nights.

( 01:19:39 ) Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you.

( 01:19:39 ) Feeling that it's gone.

( 01:19:39 ) Can't change your mind.

( 01:19:39 ) If we can't go on.

( 01:19:39 ) To survive the tide.

( 01:19:39 ) Love divides.

( 01:19:39 ) Someday, love will find you.

( 01:19:39 ) Break those chains that bind you.

( 01:19:39 ) One night will remind you.

( 01:19:39 ) How we touched and went our separate ways.

( 01:19:39 ) If he ever hurts you.

( 01:19:39 ) True love won't desert you.

( 01:19:39 ) You know I still love you.

( 01:19:39 ) Though we touched and went our separate ways.

( 01:19:39 ) Troubled times.

( 01:19:39 ) Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain.

( 01:19:39 ) Distant eyes.

( 01:19:39 ) Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain.

( 01:19:39 ) If you must go, I wish you luck.

( 01:19:39 ) You'll never walk alone.

( 01:19:39 ) Take care, my love.

( 01:19:39 ) Miss you, love.

( 01:19:39 ) Someday, love will find you.

( 01:19:39 ) Break those chains that bind you.

( 01:19:39 ) One night will remind you.

( 01:19:39 ) How we touched and went our separate ways.

( 01:19:39 ) If he ever hurts you.

( 01:19:39 ) True love won't desert you.

( 01:19:39 ) You know I still love you.

( 01:19:39 ) Though we touched and went our separate ways. Oh, someday, love will find you.

( 01:20:59 ) Break those chains that bind you.

( 01:20:59 ) One night will remind you.

( 01:20:59 ) If he ever hurts you.

( 01:20:59 ) True love won't desert you.

( 01:20:59 ) You know I still love you.

Speaker 13 ( 01:23:11 ):

Legend, that's a title reserved for a select few. It's not given. It's earned through hard work, grit, perseverance. The standard is excellence for those who inspire us, shape our world, and make us think differently. Here, we walk in the footsteps of champions, joining a community that will take us further faster. This is where ambition meets opportunity and where legends are made.

Speaker 14 ( 01:27:08 ):

Please welcome back to the stage, the 29th president of the University of Alabama, Dr. Stuart R. Bell.

Dr. Stuart R. Bell ( 01:27:32 ):

Welcome back. Well, graduates your time at the University of Alabama is certainly part of something much larger than any one moment. You're part of a legacy that stretches back generations and forward into the future that only you are going to be able to define. And tonight, let's just say it's not over yet. Let's make some more memories.

( 01:27:59 ) Some very special guests are about to take the stage, an individual who has left a lasting mark on this university and whose presence tonight truly makes this celebration unprecedented. But before they join us, I do want to take a final moment to say something from the heart, and that is, thank you.

( 01:28:19 ) Thank you for choosing Alabama. Thank you for your work, your energy, the late nights. Graduates, were there any late nights? Roll tide. And the leadership that you have shown on this campus and beyond, you have made an impact. You've built a community. You have raised the standard. And tonight, we celebrate with you, Class of 2025.

( 01:28:44 ) It's now my pleasure to introduce someone who needs no introduction to Alabama fans. Coach Nick Saban didn't just win championships. He built a culture of excellence that set a standard in college football and taught us all the power of teamwork, self-discipline, and unwavering focus on the process of getting better every day. He challenged our student athletes to be champions, not just on the field, but in the classroom and in life.

( 01:29:24 ) Please show your appreciation for the legendary former coach of the Crimson Tide and one of the greatest coaches in history, Nick Saban.

Nick Saban ( 01:29:58 ):

Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Dr. Bell. And first off, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank you for your extraordinary leadership here at the University of Alabama over the last 10 years. You made the university better. You made me better. You helped us have a successful program because we always had the support that we needed.

( 01:30:22 ) Leadership is all about serving other people, and Dr. Bell created a great example. He was somebody that we all could emulate. He helped others for their benefit, which is what service is all about. His integrity, humility, and unwavering focus to the students here is something that is unprecedented, so I would like to get a round of applause for Dr. Bell for 10 years of tremendous service to the University of Alabama.

( 01:30:57 ) It's certainly an honor for me to be here and participate in this historic event, to be able to introduce President Trump to address the graduates here today, so it's a special moment for me. But I got to be honest with you, I feel like I'm the warm-up band for The Rolling Stones, and the first song they're going to play is Start Me Up.

( 01:31:27 ) But really, to all the students here, I want to congratulate you on the hard work and commitment that you've made to be able to graduate, create a future for yourself, but I want you to remember something. You've created an opportunity to create a legacy now. And if you remember back in 2009 when we won our first national championship here, we had a celebration in the stadium, and I said, "This is not the end. This is the beginning."

( 01:31:58 ) The reason I made that statement is I wanted our players and the people in the program and our supporters at the university to realize that we wanted to create a legacy of success. Well, that's what you have the opportunity to do now. You're going to face new challenges. This is going to be a new beginning for you, new challenges, new horizons, new opportunities, new obstacles to overcome.

( 01:32:21 ) I'm sure the University of Alabama has provided a lot of resources for you to be ready to do that, and our faculty here has helped you prepare for what you need to do to have a successful legacy in the future. But I always tell people that you need to be very wise about the goals that you set. But more importantly, you got to define what do I need to do to accomplish those goals?

( 01:32:52 ) That's called the process, the very things that you need to do on a day-to-day basis to be able to accomplish the goals that you have. You need to define that for yourself, and then you have to have the discipline to execute it every day. I'm talking about self-discipline because we make hundreds of decisions every day that come down to two questions. Here's something I know I'm supposed to do that I really don't want to do. Can you make yourself do it?

( 01:33:16 ) On this hand, there's something you're not supposed to do but you want to do it. Can you keep yourself from it? If you can make those choices and decisions the right way, you'll be able to always make progress toward the goals and aspirations and things that you want to achieve. So making the right choices is very, very important.

( 01:33:35 ) When you embark on this journey. There's three things that I think always help me. First of all, have compassion for other people. Treat people like you would like to be treated. Treat people nicely on your way up. You might meet them on the way down. So it's nice to be important, but it's also more important to be nice. So that was the first thing, compassion for other people.

( 01:33:56 ) The second thing is be responsible for your own self-determination. You got to earn it. Don't look at somebody else. Don't blame somebody else. You be responsible for your own self-determination and have accountability for what your job is and what you need to do. The last thing is, it's not about beating the other guy. It's not about being better than somebody else. It's about you being the best that you can be.

( 01:34:21 ) We won 26 games when I played Pop Warner Football, in a row. Then we won 30-some in high school in a row, and it was never good enough. I could never understand that. But my dad said, "It's not about beating the other guy. It's about you being the best that you can be at whatever you choose to do."

( 01:34:39 ) I'm going to leave you with this. The first speech that I gave in 17 straight years here was to get the players to understand how important it was for them to be their best is I paraphrased Martin Luther King's old Street Sweeper Sermon. He started out saying, "There's only one guy in the Green Stamps store at Montgomery, Alabama, that I'll let shine my shoes because the pride that guy has in shining shoes and the smile he gets on his face when you told him he did a good job."

( 01:35:09 ) Then he goes on to say, "If you're going to be a street sweeper, be the best street sweeper in the world. Sweep the streets like Michelangelo painted the Sistine Chapel, like Shakespeare wrote literature. Let them put a sign up that says, 'The best street sweeper in the world lives right here.' And if you do that, you accomplish the best there is in life, knowing you did your best to be the best you'd be, no matter what you choose to do."

( 01:35:30 ) So from Ms. Terry and myself, we want to congratulate the 2025 graduating class of the University of Alabama and wish you the very best in the future.

( 01:35:53 ) Before I introduce President Trump, I have to tell you a story. You all know that we win a national championship,

Nick Saban ( 01:36:00 ):

… get to go to the White House, and it's a great experience for our players in each and every year. When we won in 2017, President Trump was there 2018, very gracious host. And he's the first president that invited us to come in the Oval Office. So I take the three captains in the Oval Office and President's really nice to everybody, and he's got this very big, good-looking auspicious box on his desk that has a red button on top, and one of the players said, is that what you launch the missiles with? And he said, well, push it and find out. Player said, no, I don't want to do that. He said, oh, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, push it, see what happens. Find out. So Rashaan Evans finally got the guts up, went over, pushed the red button. Some lady came in with a Coke on a tray.

( 01:36:56 ) So I really want to express my appreciation to President Trump for choosing the University of Alabama for his commencement address and making time to speak to our graduates. Now, if it is my distinct honor to introduce our next speaker, please join me in welcoming the 45th and 47th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.

Audience ( 01:37:21 ):

Donald Trump ( 01:38:32 ):

Thank you, coach. Wow. What a nice looking group this is. What a beautiful group of people. And especially a very big hello to the University of Alabama. Congratulations to the class of 2025. Roll tide. Roll tide. There are things that happen in life that are very important and you always remember where you were when they happened. As a student at Alabama you'll always remember where you were when your head coach Nick Saban retired. Remember that? Because he's done such a fantastic job. The last time I was here… And that's true with Nick. What a great coach. Let's bring him back. No, you have a good coach right now though. You have a good coach right now. He was great.

( 01:39:34 ) But the last time I was here, the Crimson Tide beat the Georgia Bulldogs, 41 to 33. I was here. I got to watch it. That was some game. Today, it's my pleasure to return to this campus as the first president ever to deliver to the keynote commencement address to this truly great American university. It's a great school. And there's nowhere I'd rather be than right here in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Titletown USA, that's what it's become. And I love this place. Maybe it's because I won Alabama by 45 points. Could that be the reason? The way they say like the polls have closed in Alabama, Trump has won Alabama immediately. It was very quick. It was very, very quick and nasty. That's what we like.

( 01:40:32 ) They put all seven of your commencement ceremonies, I don't know if you know this, but they put them all together first time ever, so I better do well or I'm in big trouble. But I want to thank President Bell for his 10 years of distinguished service, highly respected gentleman, but 10 years of service to this great university overseeing the education of 100,000 proud Alabama graduates. That's something to have on your record. I also want to thank Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, who's here with us, and she's a fantastic… Where is? She's around here someplace. She's here. I just took a picture. I said, you're doing a great job.

( 01:41:14 ) Along with the very wonderful man, a friend of mine, Senator Tommy Tuberville. Where's Tommy? Tommy's good. When he wanted to run for the Senate, I said, well, you beat Alabama six times in a row. How can you run for the Senate? He said, well, I just look at him and I say, well, I was responsible for them getting Nick Saban. I said, that's a good reason. And he won. Very easily he won, but I'll never forget that.

( 01:41:45 ) Thanks also to a wonderful person, Representative Lisa McClain, a great person, great, highly respected, Gary Palmer, Robert Aderholt, Dale Strong, Ronnie Jackson, Ralph Norman, along with Lieutenant Governor Will Ainsworth, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, great people. Alabama Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, Chancellor Sid Trant and members of the University of Alabama Board of Trustees.

( 01:42:24 ) But most importantly, and they would agree with this, let's give a big round of applause to your incredible parents, grandparents, and family members. As they made this wonderful day possible. [inaudible 01:42:45] great. Without them, it doesn't happen. Without them, you probably aren't here and you wouldn't have that big beautiful smile on your faces. This year, the graduating Alabama class of 2025 has over 6,600 graduates. You're the largest class in school history. Among your ranks are among the 800 first-generation college students and nearly 3000 students from right here in the great state of Alabama. Amazing.

( 01:43:19 ) And this class also includes many Rhodes Scholars, Goldwater Scholars, 213 Merit Scholars, and over 1,500 students graduating with red caps. You know what that signifies? 4.0 GPA. That's a lot of students. That's a lot of students. [inaudible 01:43:47] That's pretty good. I know who I'd pick. I'd look for a red cap. I'd say I want you to work for the beautiful Trump administration, this lovely administration.

( 01:43:57 ) In addition, the class of 2025 has nearly 130 active duty service members, veterans and members of the University of Alabama ROTC. Thank you very much. Thank you. Everywhere you look, you can see the fierce spirit of this school, but nowhere more clearly than in your world-class athletics is nothing like it, probably., There's no school like it. That's why I would like to recognize the 11 graduating seniors on the University of Alabama Football Team. Where may they be? Where are they? You just have to look and they're about a foot taller than everybody else. Oh, great. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Great season. Thank you. Thank you. Great season.

( 01:44:52 ) There was something truly special about the players, coaches and the fans who packed the stands at Bryant-Denny Stadium and proudly sing Dixieland Delight. We like that. Alabama has changed college football forever and inscribed into the history books, the names of Bear Bryant, Joe Namath, four Heisman Trophy winners, and of course the great Nick Saban. This place is truly where legends are made. It really is. It's a special place. When your president called, we talked about it. It took me about two seconds to say, I'll go. I wasn't looking to do it. And we are busy. We're winning a lot of battles right now. We love winning. Don't we love winning? We're winning a lot of battles.

( 01:45:46 ) But I wanted to do this. For the University of Alabama good isn't good enough, tough isn't tough enough and great isn't great enough. The Crimson Tide does not rest, does not quit and does not stop winning until it's all time. It's all time. You're always winning and you're going to keep winning. That's why the University of Alabama Football Team has won more games in the last decade than any college football team in America. That's not bad. And it's why last fall you beat Auburn for the fifth year in a row. That's not bad. That's not bad.

( 01:46:33 ) The University of Alabama has a brand and that brand is winning. That brand is winning. Great school. Last year, the Crimson Chaos watched the Tide hoops make it to the Final Four for the first time ever, and this year you built on your incredible record and returned to the Elite Eight. So not only is Alabama a great football school, it's now one of the nation's best basketball schools and congratulations. And I love sports and I think I should have come here. I think I should have come here. Congratulations as well to the women's track and field team for winning two SEC titles this year, that's something. And as long as I'm president, we will always protect women's sports. Men will not play in women's sports. No way. No way.

( 01:47:44 ) They say that's an 80/20 issue. No, it's a 97/3 issue I think. No men will not be playing in women's sports. I said that and I classified it with a very powerful executive order, as you know it's done. The class of 2025 was the first to enter the halls of this university in the aftermath of COVID-19. Following a difficult senior year of high school many of you came here to Tuscaloosa from around the country and for the very first time you experienced something called freedom. You had freedom. So let's give a big round of applause to the leaders of the state who chose liberty over lockdowns. They did. They did. Good job. As you know, there are a few campuses in the world more beautiful than this one, and there are a few memories sweeter than the ones you have formed really at this capstone, and at the capstone you'll miss the beautiful sounds of Denny Chimes, the excitement of lining the Walk of Champions, the Saturday tailgates at the Quad. As you graduate, it's natural to reflect on four years of happy memories and you've really had happy memories here. You've done a lot of winning. Winning is a good thing to do.

( 01:49:10 ) But today I am also asking you to look forward to really something very, very bright and more promising, and it's going to be an even more promising tomorrow. I promise you that. You are the first graduating class of the golden age of America. We're in the golden age. You watch, this is the golden age. This is the golden age. We've done things that nobody thought possible. 100 days yesterday. 100 days, and we've done things that nobody thought even possible.

( 01:49:48 ) Like many generations before you you're graduating at an exciting time for our nation, a period of both extraordinary change and incredible potential and what will be unbelievable growth. You're going to see that very soon. You're going to see it starting very, very soon. Whole world is talking about it. Our country has always been defined by its ability to reform and reinvent itself, to meet the challenges of the next era.

( 01:50:16 ) The last four years were not good for our country. But don't let that scare you, it was an aberration. We're run by people who truly, at that time, four years, we were run by people that didn't have a clue. They didn't have a clue, and I'm trying to be nice when I say it that way. They allowed our beautiful USA to be laughed at, scorned and taken advantage of by everybody. We were ripped off on trade by nations all over the world, both friend and foe, and oftentimes a friend was far worse on trade than the. But those days are over. You're at the start of something very, very big. You're going to see that very soon.

( 01:50:57 ) Now, exactly 250 years after the first patriots stood and fought at Lexington and Concord we're in the midst of another kind of revolution, a revolution of winning and a revolution of common sense. Common sense. Everywhere you look, broken systems, corrupt institutions and tired dogmas are being swept away by the tide of history. Ancient wisdom is being rediscovered, and the best and strongest traits of America are coming back for all to see, bigger, better, and greater than ever. Coming back, and they're coming back fast. The spirit of our age is one of boldness, vigor, ambition, and adventure. And it's exciting to be you and young. Oh, I'd pay you a lot of money to have your age. You have a great future.

( 01:51:56 ) The people have rejected the voices of a failed establishment. You saw that in the election. We've turned the page on endless wars, crippling debt, open borders, ruinous inflation, and the lack of respect for our country and for its leaders. But we're turning that all around and we're turning it around very fast. We will very quickly make America great again. This week we're celebrating the most successful first 100 days of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And we've been given a lot of credit for that. But 100 days does not have full term make. But we're going to do even better as we move along. In a matter of weeks, we've achieved the lowest number of illegal border crossings ever recorded. And you've seen it hundreds of thousands of people pouring into our country, from prisons, from mental institutions, from gangs and all over the world, not just in South America. You'd see hundreds of thousands of people pour course in one day. You know what, we had just recently? Three. Three. Three. And we slashed the number of illegal aliens released into the United States by 99.999%. And if that number's wrong, the fake news, which is all over the place today, is going to be correcting me before I get to the next sentence. Now, 99.999%. How about that? Nobody thought that was possible. They said you needed legislation. No, you just needed a new president. That's what you needed.

( 01:54:10 ) But despite the tremendous success, as you've been reading, the courts are trying to stop me from doing the job that I was elected to do. We won by millions of votes. We won all seven swing states. Seven out of seven. We won 312 electoral college votes. They said, oh, 270 would be great. We won 312 and 2,750 counties versus 525 counties throughout the nation. That's why when you look at a map, it's all red. It's all red. Every inch of it is red. A little couple of blue dots. But they have to let us do the job that the voters want us to do. Judges are interfering supposedly based on due process. But how can you give due process to people who came into our country illegally? They want to give them due process. I don't know.

( 01:55:01 ) But the price of food has gone down and mortgage rates are down, and gasoline prices just hit $1.88 a gallon in three states. Can you believe it? It was at 3.50. It was at four… We're drilling. Oh, we're drilling. You know drill baby drill, right? We drill baby drill. We do that. We got it down. We have it going good. And when energy drops that much, you don't have much inflation. It's hard to have inflation. It was just announced that in the first quarter, investments in the United States are up 22%, that we're leading the whole world in investment. Everybody's pouring into our country big dollars. And it's all about November 5th, the November 5th election, and tariffs and incentives that we've given that are going to make this country so much richer.

( 01:56:57 ) We have $36 trillion in debt that's going to start to come off, it's going to come off rapidly. But we'll be over $8 trillion in investment with Apple and others investing $500 billion each. We've never had a period of time in two months, because we're here for three months, a little bit more, but give me a break for the first month, had to get a little acclimated. Had to see where the enemy lies. They're already looking to impeach Trump, these crazy people. Let's impeach him. For what? We don't know exactly, but we'll try. These people are crazy. So we had to get our bearings for the first couple of weeks. So in two months we had over $8 trillion, think of it, committed. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. There's never been anything like it in any country at any time and it's all because they want to avoid the tariffs. We want to get here fast.

( 01:57:53 ) I said a number of times, tariff, it's the most beautiful word in the world. And I got absolutely decimated by the fake news. They said, what about love? What about your wife? What about your parents? What about religion and God? So I said, all right, it's the fifth-nicest word I've ever seen, and since I've done that, I've been in good shape. Nobody's bothered me. They've been very nice. So it's the fifth most beautiful word I've ever heard, but it's making us very rich and you'll be seeing the results pretty soon, sooner than most people think. Because that's what other countries have been doing to us. Just so you understand, they were tariffing the hell out of us. We couldn't sell cars in Europe. We couldn't sell cars in China. We couldn't sell cars in Japan or anywhere else. We couldn't do anything. And all we're doing is we're doing it to them, but we're doing it much better.

( 01:58:43 ) And the US military is suddenly seeing its best recruiting numbers ever. We've never had numbers like that. We now have waiting lists because there is such incredible spirit in our country. There's a great spirit. And just think six months ago, and you remember, it was embarrassing, before the election six months ago we were hearing and reading that numbers of those joining our military were at the worst levels ever. We've never had anything like it, right? You remember that? And now they're at the best levels ever. We have waiting lists to get into the military. We couldn't fill the positions. And that included in our police forces, our fire departments. We love our fire departments also. We can never forget our fire departments. But our police forces were begging for help, and now they're brimming over with people and applicants and they're getting great ones. It's amazing what's taken place, and that's really the spirit. Each of the graduates in this arena will soon have the chance to help lead this project of national renewal. And that's what it is. It's a national renewal.

( 01:59:59 ) We suffered so badly for four years. We had one of the greatest economies. We actually had the greatest economy in the history of our country during the first term of Trump, and then we got hit hard with inflation during the Biden economy. It was horrible. We were hit so hard. The worst probably ever. They say 48 years, we'll accept that. But I would say ever. You'll embrace this moment and you'll step forward with strength and grit, faith and patriotism to put America on a new trajectory for your children. And then you'll take your place among the greatest generations in the history of our country.

( 02:00:37 ) I think you have a chance to be the greatest generation in the history of our country because we're turning it around and you happen to be available. You're available. That's a good time to be available. There are some times when it's not so good to be available, but this is a great time. I'm absolutely confident that the Alabama class of 2025 is up to the task. Are you up to the task?

( 02:01:11 ) You learned a lot about winning here at Alabama, and now we need you to help win for America. For the business majors here today I challenge you not merely to use your talents for financial speculation, but to apply your great skills that you've learned and had to forging the steel and pouring the concrete of new American factories, plants, shipyards, and even cities which are going up all over our country. Don't just build a strong portfolio. Build a very, very strong America, and you're going to do that.

( 02:01:54 ) To the engineers, brilliant you are, technician, scientists and math majors, we need your Alabama spirit and competition to keep our country at the forefront of every single domain. America should have the world's tallest buildings, designed the fastest airplanes, build the greatest cars, do everything the absolute best, better than any other nation in the world, and you can do it. And we will soon land American astronauts on Mars. That will happen. That will happen. In every field you have studied there are problems to be solved and breakthroughs to be made. To the journalism majors of which I've had a lot problems with, I must be honest. I'm not sure I like them. No, I do. I do. But you're really leading [inaudible 02:02:51] because we need a great and free press. We need a brilliant press. They're like a watch-keeper. They're very important, and you can go out and take it down a new track. Help save the country. So important. Your task is so important, and it's to build a media that Americans can trust. And remember, the people of this country they know the truth when they hear it. That's why the ratings, the approval numbers of the media are so low. We need those ratings to be 100%. We have to be able to trust our media. They say you have to have that, you need strong, strong borders, and you need really free, fair, clean elections. You need those things. But the media is a big part of it.

( 02:03:37 ) In the world of health and medicine, there is an exciting new movement to get poisons out of our food supply, keep toxins out of our government, clean out our environment, and make America healthy again. And I think Bobby's going to do a great job, don't you? I think so. I think he's the guy we needed. And in government, it is the task of your generation to replace bureaucracy, graft, and waste with a new system that defends American freedom. These are big tasks before you, but the reward for your hard work will be the United States of America is stronger, prouder, better, and more unified than ever, ever, ever before, it's going to be. As you embark on this great adventure, let me share some of the biggest lessons I've learned from a lifetime spent building dreams and beating the odds. I've beat a lot of odds. A lot of odds. A lot of people said, I don't know. But it worked out okay. Where are we? Oh gee, I'm president. How did that happen? Now you're going to be in the same position. But, would you like to hear some of the ideas or should I just skip over that part? Huh? That's going to be more interesting than all the other stuff, which was slightly political, right? I'm going to give it to you though, just as I see it and as I've learned it the hard way and the easy way.

( 02:05:14 ) First, if you are here today and think that you're too young to do something great, let me tell you that you are wrong. You're not too young. You can have great success at a very young age. You're all very young. In America with drive and ambition young people can do anything. I was 28 when I took my first big gamble to develop a hotel in midtown Manhattan, the Grand Hyatt, and it worked out incredibly well. But I was very young at the time. I was a very young person in sort of an old person business.

( 02:05:48 ) Steve Jobs was 21 when he founded Apple. Walt Disney was 21 when he founded Disney. James Madison, James Monroe, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, They were no older than 25 when they began the journeys that etched their names into the history books for all time. So to everyone here today, don't waste your youth. Go out and fight right from the beginning, from the day you leave this incredible university, go out and fight. Fight tough, fight fair, but go out and fight. You're going to be very successful because now is the time to work harder than you've ever worked before. Push yourself further than you have ever pushed yourself before. Find your limits and then smash through everything. Go and smash through. You've watched that football team smash through, you're going to do the same thing.

( 02:06:42 ) You're at the age when you have the time and vitality to do really incredible things if you just give it your all. You'll look back and a decade from now, you'll be astounded by what you've achieved. You'll remember this day. You'll remember when the guy named Trump was giving the commencement address and he said, I could do it. And guess what? I did. I think you're going to remember that very fondly. I hope so.

( 02:07:14 ) Second of all, and very importantly, you have to love what you do. You have to. I rarely see somebody that's successful, that doesn't love what he or she does. That's way you really, like work isn't work. It's fun. I find it fun. I work all the time and I find it fun. If I didn't find it fun, I wouldn't be successful. Whether it was real estate or in show biz, had a lot of different careers, but I loved real estate so much and I was very successful at real estate because I loved it. I learned a lot from my father because I watched him work. He worked 70… He was a workaholic. He worked. He loved to work. He was a good man. He was a tough guy. Tough as hell, actually. Now that I think back, I don't know if you could even get away with that nowadays.

Donald Trump ( 02:08:00 ):

… nowadays. He was tough, but he was a good man, I'll tell you. And he worked seven days a week. He worked Saturdays, Sundays. It didn't matter. And I learned by watching him. He loved his life. He loved what he was doing. Had a great long-term marriage, a long, long, many, many, many years. He beat me on that one.

( 02:08:18 ) Mine are very successful, but haven't lasted quite as long. It was close to 70 years. It was a long time. Said, "Pop, you beat me on that one." But you know what I learned from him? That he loved life, and all he did was work. I see people that don't work hard, and they're miserable, so go out and find. But he loved what he was doing. And you have to find something that you love, and you have to follow your own instincts.

( 02:08:45 ) Listen to your parents. They're very wise, but you have to follow your instincts and your heart, your soul, and you want to be the very, very best you can be. Treat every day like a home game against Auburn. Fight like hell and enjoy doing it. And your coach can tell you all about that.

( 02:09:04 ) Third thing is to think big. You're going to do something, you might as well think big, because it's just as tough. You can think small. I know a lot of people, they thought small. They're very smart. I know others that weren't nearly as smart, but they had a better picture of the big picture because it's just as hard to solve a small problem as a big problem. And it's just as much energy and everything else except the result is going to be a smaller one. So, love what you do, but think big if it's possible.

( 02:09:33 ) Now, if it's not possible, that's okay too. You do something, you have to do something that you love. You will have all the same headaches and challenges, all the same delays and setbacks. So, you might as well do something that's just amazing. America doesn't aim small. Alabama doesn't aim small, and neither do you. So, think big when possible. Think big.

( 02:09:55 ) Fourth is work hard. Work hard. Never, ever stop. An example is a great athlete, actually. Gary Player, golfer. Great, great golfer. He wasn't as big as other men. He was actually on the small side. Don't tell him that. Friend of mine. Don't tell him that because he doesn't understand that.

( 02:10:20 ) But he worked very, very hard. He made up for it. He never stopped. He won 168 golf tournaments. Think of that, 100. I said, "Gary, you're winning like every weekend. Do you ever choke or anything??

( 02:10:30 ) "I don't know what choke means."

( 02:10:33 ) And he made a statement years ago that I read, and I thought it was sort of an incredible statement. He said, "It's funny, the harder I work, the luckier I get."

( 02:10:44 ) Right? Think of that, "The harder I work, the luckier I get." So, you really have to work hard. And you're going to be successful because you have the talent. To get into this school is not easy. To get through it is even more difficult. You have a lot of talent.

( 02:10:59 ) Fifth is don't lose your momentum. You just want to keep it going. And you have to know if you are losing it, you have to know when you're losing it. So, maybe you stop, and maybe it's time to stop. Listen to the feedback, think through your plan very carefully, and keep moving fast.

( 02:11:18 ) The word momentum is very important. I mean, I'll just tell you a little story about a great real estate developer named William Levitt. He built Levittown. Some of you might live in a Levittown. He was the biggest developer of the whole country in the 1940s.

( 02:11:31 ) And he built these jobs. He started with one house, then two houses, then 20 houses, then thousands and thousands of houses. And a company, Gulf & Western, came along and they said, "We're going to make you an offer to buy your company."

( 02:11:49 ) And they offered him a lot of money. A lot of money, more money than he ever thought he could make. And he retired. Lost his momentum. He retired, and he led a beautiful life. He had a wife. I must tell you, it was his second wife. It was a trophy wife. What can I say? I don't like telling you everything, but we're all friends, right? Can we talk? We're all friends.

( 02:12:11 ) He had a trophy wife, and he lived a different life. He moved to the south of France, but he lived, it was a life of tremendous luxury. He had so many millions of dollars. He was given a fortune for the company. And 10 years went by, and then 15 years went by, and he got a call from this big conglomerate Gulf & Western, and they said, "We're not doing well with the purchase."

( 02:12:35 ) Because he used to pick up every nail, every piece of sawdust, every piece of wood, every chip, everything. And he'd sell it. He'd make a couple of bucks. Everything was perfect. They can't do that. These big companies, they don't do that. You see it a lot when an entrepreneur sells to a big company, and then he ends up buying the company back for peanuts later on. Happens a lot.

( 02:12:56 ) But he was the best at what he did. But 15 years went by, and he was so excited. And they sold him back his company. And he started, and he was going to tear apart the world because he got bored with a life of luxury.

( 02:13:10 ) And he started building and building and building, and the markets turned on him, and he went bad. He lost everything. And he went bankrupt, absolutely bankrupt. And it was a sad story to read. It was such an amazing story because he was so rich, but he paid them. And he bought it for the right price, bought it low, but he went wild.

( 02:13:32 ) But he lost his momentum. He wasn't good at it anymore. And he was at a party on Fifth Avenue, I'll never forget. And it was a party of a very, very powerful man who was having the party in a magnificent apartment overlooking the park. And I walked in, and there were 50 or so people. I recognized most of them, all the biggest business people in the world, actually. Very glamorous.

( 02:13:56 ) I was doing well. I was young, and I was doing well. And I was invited to parties like that. And I looked in the corner, and there was Mr. William Levitt sitting all by himself on a chair, looking very glum. Nobody was talking to him because you'll find that when you're not successful, you lose a lot of friends. It's not a good situation.

( 02:14:16 ) But there was nobody talking to him, but I wanted to talk to him because I was in the real estate business, and he was, and most of these people were in different businesses.

( 02:14:24 ) And I went over and talked to him. And I said, "How are you, Mr. Levitt?"

( 02:14:28 ) He goes, " Donald." He knew who I was, "Not well. I'm not well."

( 02:14:35 ) I said, "So, can you come back?"

( 02:14:39 ) He said, "No, son. I lost my momentum. I shouldn't have done it. I lost my momentum."

( 02:14:44 ) And I never forgot that expression. He lost his momentum. If he would have kept going instead of selling and relaxing and going into a different life, he probably would have been three times bigger than he was.

( 02:14:59 ) But he lost his momentum. And you have to know when it's your time. I mean, there'll be a time when you do lose. You see it with fighters. You see it with a lot of people. They have a great record, and they retire. And then four years later they say, "I'm going back. I can beat that guy." And they get knocked to hell. And it's not good. It's not good.

( 02:15:18 ) So, he lost his momentum. You have to know when your momentum time is up. I call it momentum time, but follow your momentum. It's a very important word. You don't hear it from too many, but I've seen it. I've seen it a lot.

( 02:15:33 ) Number six, if you want to change the world, you have to have the courage to be an outsider. In other words, you have to take certain risks and do things a little bit differently. Otherwise, if that weren't the case, everybody would be successful.

( 02:15:46 ) Doesn't work that way.Progress never comes from those satisfied with the failures of a broken system. It comes from those who want to fix the broken system. And you'll make the bigger money. You'll make them more success by acting that way. The other way may be more secure. But if you want to go to the top, you're just never going to do it unless you break the system.

( 02:16:09 ) Change is never easy. And the closer you get to success, the more ferociously those with a vested interest in the past will resist you. They want to resist.

( 02:16:19 ) So, I just say trust me on that because I know. You really do. You have to break the system a little bit and follow your own instincts. But if your vision is right, nothing will hold you down. Nothing. You have to have the right vision.

( 02:16:35 ) If you look at some of these Internet people, I know so many of them. Elon is so terrific. But I know now all of them. They all hated me in my first term, and now they're kissing my ass. [inaudible 02:16:49] It's true. All of them. It's true. It's amazing. It's nicer this way.

( 02:17:01 ) Now, in the first, they didn't know what happened because I won an election that, there was never a businessman that won a presidential election. Out of 100%, 8% were generals, and 92% were politicians. Not even admirals, not even, just generals. Eight generals, General Washington, General Grant, generals. General Eisenhower.

( 02:17:27 ) But 8% were generals, and 92% were politicians. And when I ran, everyone said, "Well, he can't win. He's a businessman. That's not going to work."

( 02:17:39 ) But you have a natural instinct for things. I guess I had a natural instinct. I said to somebody, "Was I a better businessman or politician?"

( 02:17:46 ) And they said, "Well, there are a lot of guys that made a lot of money, but there's only one guy that became president that was a businessman. So, I guess you're a better politician."

( 02:17:55 ) But I don't think of myself as a politician. I think of myself as a businessman, and I'm proud of that. And I've applied business instinct, and that's why I think you're seeing us doing so well.

( 02:18:10 ) So, number seven is to trust your instincts. Common sense. You can go very far in life with common sense. And I applied that to politics because some of these things, like they had open borders. Let everybody in the whole world flow into our country. That's not common sense.

( 02:18:26 ) They had transgender for everybody. We ended that, if you noticed, okay? But they had transgender for everybody. I said, "This is not working. This is not going to work."

( 02:18:42 ) As I said before, so simple, men playing in women's sports. Did you ever see some of the records? Did you ever see some of these boxing matches? We have to protect. These women are great athletes, but we have to protect. If you looked at the Olympics where they had transitions people going into the boxing where the women had boxing, and they had a great champion, a female boxer.

( 02:19:07 ) I mean, after one punch, she walked back to the corner said, "I can't get hit like that. I've never been hit like that before."

( 02:19:13 ) You look at all the volleyball players that have been hurt so badly with balls that are hit at levels that they've never seen before, but the greatest is weightlifting. You ever see the weightlifting, where they have a record that wasn't broken in 18 years? And they have, should I imitate it? My wife gets very upset when I do this. She said, "Darling, it's not presidential."

( 02:19:36 ) I said, "Yeah, but people like it."

( 02:19:39 ) Should I do it or not?

Group ( 02:19:40 ):

Do it, yes.

Donald Trump ( 02:19:42 ):

All right, I'm in trouble when I get home, but that's okay. What the hell? I've been in lots of trouble before. But you look at the weightlifting, where 18 years it stands, and they have this young woman, and her parents are right where you are in the front row. And they're so proud of her, and it's like 209 pounds, and she's going to lift that.

( 02:20:02 ) The record stood for 18, think of it, 18 years. And they put an eighth of an ounce here and an eighth of an ounce here, little tiny, little bit. And she's going to do it, "Mom, I love you. I'm going to do it for you, Mom."

( 02:20:17 ) And she goes. And she lifts. And she gets it, "Mom, I'm going to do it. Mom. Can't do it." And then a guy comes along or a gal or whatever, a transitioned person comes along. And he was a failed weightlifter as a man, but he comes along, 206 pounds. They put the little thing on, and he goes, boom, boom. And breaks a record by 119 pounds. That's not right. The other one is the swimming. You've heard me talk about it. Great swimmers, and they rose to the top. Women swimmers, and they grew up together. And they're Olympic-class swimmers, and they're qualifying for some big tournament. And now the race is getting ready to start, the big race.

( 02:21:18 ) And one young lady, she was going to set the record. She fought all her life to set the record, just to win it by one-ninth of a second. Think of that, one-ninth. I don't like those odds, one-ninth of a second, right?

( 02:21:33 ) But she looks to the left and she sees all the friends that she grew up with down in California, from all over the country. They're all the best swimmers. Then she looks to the right, and she sees the same thing, but there's a person next to her who's a giant.

( 02:21:48 ) And she looks and she, "Oh my God, who is that? I don't recognize that person."

( 02:21:53 ) That was a person that transitioned, and he had the wingspan of Wilt the Stilt Chamberlain, if anybody knows him. And as you know what happened, she was very, very badly injured in that meet because he went by her so fast that she was windburned, had to take her out. She got serious windburn. He flew back and forth and back and forth, and she didn't know what, but she got the hell knocked out of her. Knowing that, I'm only kidding. She wasn't windburned. She was just beaten by a lot.

( 02:22:29 ) Or the race, did you see the race where they had the best female runners, and they had a guy who was a decent runner, a long-distance race? And he won by five hours and 19 seconds. Normally, you win by 12 seconds, two seconds, a quarter of a second. He won by five hours and 19 seconds. It's crazy.

( 02:22:49 ) And honestly, it's demeaning for women, very demeaning. These are great athletes. It's very demeaning. And we are going to protect women. We're going to protect women. We're going to protect everybody. So, now that I'm in trouble with my wife, I'm going to blame the University of Alabama for asking me to go through with that stuff. But it's pretty descriptive, isn't it, really? It helps when you know that borders are not racist. Speech is not violence. America is good. Terrorists are bad. Men can never become women. Police are not criminals. And criminals are not victims.

( 02:23:32 ) Eighth, everybody should believe. Thank you. Thank you very much. Everybody should believe in the American dream. It's real. It's there, and it's right before you. We're coming back to the American brand.

( 02:23:58 ) Ninth, think of yourself as a winner. The power of positive thinking. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale from many years ago wrote a book, The Power of Positive Thinking. And there is a lot to it. The Power of Positive Thinking. Don't consider yourself a victim. Consider yourself a winner. In recent years, too many of our young people have really been taught to think of themselves as victims, and blame people and be angry. Don't be angry.

( 02:24:28 ) But in America, we reject that idea that anyone is born a victim. Our heroes are the ones who take charge of their own destiny, make their own luck, and determine their own fate. Despite the odds, despite all odds, that's what happens. They take really, they're given a little chance, in many cases, very little chance of success, and they become the most successful people in the world.

( 02:24:51 ) Whether you were born rich or poor, black or white, male or female in America, anyone can be a winner and our whole country will be cheering you on. And I'll be at the front of the line cheering you on, especially because you come from this incredible university.

( 02:25:09 ) And next is to be an original. The all-time greats were people who had the confidence to be a little different. Teddy Roosevelt, Douglas MacArthur, George Patton, Amelia Earhart, Annie Oakley, Muhammad Ali, and so many others. So many others, far too many to name, lived their lives with pride, personality, and flair.

( 02:25:36 ) God only created one of you. Remember that. God created one of you. You're all different. Some are close, but nobody is the same. You're one of a kind, so don't try to be someone else. Just be yourself.

( 02:25:50 ) And finally, and most importantly, never, ever give up. Never give up. Never give up. And I've learned anything in life, and it's so true. One of the most important things you can learn, if you just went a little bit longer, if you just held out a little bit longer, you would have been successful. The stories of that are legend, but I've learned that perseverance is everything.

( 02:26:24 ) So, whatever happens, no matter where you are in life, stay optimistic and just keep pushing forward. Just don't stop. Never, ever give up. Victory is right around the corner. I've watched Coach Saban win games that really were virtually over. You've seen it. You've been in the stands. He won a couple of games, I said, "Coach, you got lucky as hell."

( 02:26:46 ) He said, "I didn't get lucky. I'm a talented guy."

( 02:26:50 ) You know those little touchdowns that come out of nothing, he's amazing. But he's a guy that doesn't quit and doesn't know what the word quit even means. He couldn't define it. He took victory out of the jaws of defeat. And you can do that too.

( 02:27:04 ) At every stage in my career, my enemies of which there were many and probably are right now, I can think of a couple of people that don't like me too much right now, but they said that they have to do everything they can to keep me from winning, to keep me from making it. And I'm representing you, so I have to make it.

( 02:27:25 ) I have big shoulders, but these are big shoulders. I have to win for you. I'm not winning for myself. I'm winning for you. Do you remember when they said that, "Donald Trump will never become President of the United States?"

( 02:27:36 ) Remember Barack Hussein Obama said that. Barack Hussein Obama, "Donald Trump will never be president." 50 other politicians said that. Where are they now? Oh, let me see. Oh, there they are. Where are they now?

( 02:27:50 ) But here I am, standing before you as the 45th and 47th president. You heard that a lot. But against all odds, I did great in 2016. 2016, how great was that? And then I did much better in 2020. Sorry. The election was rigged, probably, but it was a rigged election.

( 02:28:18 ) And then in 2024, I made it too big to rig. I said, "We've got to do this again. We've got to do this again."

( 02:28:27 ) We made it too big to rig. We made it. That was a great expression. I said, "You've got to go and vote." Even though I was leading big in the polls, I said, "It doesn't matter. You've got to make it too big to rig."

( 02:28:40 ) And they did. They went out, and they voted and voted and voted, and we won the whole thing. And it was so good, and it's such a great mandate for our country. That's the important thing.

( 02:28:49 ) So, never let anyone tell you that something is impossible, ever, ever, ever. In America the impossible is what we all do best. There is nothing you cannot do if you are willing to fight for it. You've got to fight, fight, fight. Oh, I've heard that expression. Funny.

( 02:29:17 ) That's not here. That's not here on the, actually, most of what I've said tonight is not on the teleprompter. That's all right. Isn't it nice to have a president that doesn't need a teleprompter and can sort of have a little fun? Because I feel that this is home.

( 02:29:34 ) It's been such a great state for me. I feel it's home. When they said Alabama, I said, "That has a good ring to me."

( 02:29:41 ) But it's something nice about somebody that doesn't need a teleprompter, isn't that? But for the past four years, you've lived in a state known for its fighters, its champions and its warriors. And you've lived in the great state of Alabama, one of the greatest of them all. From Huntsville to Birmingham, from Montgomery to Mobile, and from right here in Tuscaloosa to the gleaming shores of the Gulf of America.

( 02:30:15 ) Gulf of America. That has a nice ring. Everybody loves it. I wouldn't say Mexico's thrilled, but you can't have them all. They're not thrilled. You continue the legacy of Alabama legends who blazed the trails, won the games, tilled the fields, forged the steels, built the ships and gave us the victories that built America and changed the world. The entire world was changed by our victories.

( 02:30:50 ) This is the state that gave us the might of the Iron City, the power of the Saturn V rocket and the roaring engines of Talladega. Talladega. We love Talladega. We love Talladega.

( 02:31:06 ) This is the state that gave us nothing but victory. The state of some of the greatest heroes in history like Willie Mays, Jesse Owens, Joe Lewis, your coach, Nick Saban, Hank Williams, and many others. Some of you will leave here today and travel the world, but you will always know that this state as this is really Sweet Home Alabama, right? It's always going to be your place.

( 02:31:35 ) I sort of feel that way myself, because from a political standpoint, it's just been, we connected from day one. From the first day I set my foot on this beautiful soil, I connected with Alabama. And here in Alabama, we believe that the men and women who built this country are heroes, and that America's destiny is to be the single greatest nation on the face of the Earth.

( 02:31:57 ) And we're bringing it back at speed that nobody thought was possible. We believe in freedom and family, God and country. We cherish our Constitution. We revere our Bible, and we salute our great American flag. We honor our police, we respect our veterans, and we always stand for our one and only National Anthem. We love our National Anthem.

( 02:32:32 ) We believe in strong parents, strong values, strong communities, and very strong borders. And we believe that the United States military is the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known. We have a great military. We just had people that didn't know how to lead it. We believe the South is beautiful. Alabama is great, and America is our home. We believe in the SEC and the USA.

( 02:33:13 ) Graduates of the Alabama class of 2025 standing here before you in this magnificent arena, it is clear to see the next chapter of the American story will not be written by the Harvard Crimson. It will be written by you, the Crimson Tide. True, that's true. That's true. That's true.

( 02:33:49 ) I thought that was rather clever. If you look at what's going on now, they get their 5 billion a year. That is not going to be so forthcoming. Now, wasn't that a clever one though? Who would think of that? Because this is Alabama, and at Alabama you fight, fight, fight, and you win, win, win. That's what you know how to do.

( 02:34:14 ) Congratulations to you all. Congratulations to this great class of champions. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all very much. Thank you.
