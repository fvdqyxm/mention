Reporter ( 00:00 ):

Mr. President.

( 00:00 ) He's coming. He's coming.

( 00:00 ) Mr President.

( 00:00 ) Mr President.

( 00:00 ) Mr President.

( 00:00 ) [inaudible 00:00:26]

( 00:00 ) Hi, Mr. President. Are you going to go and meet with Putin before your deadline comes in 10 days [inaudible 00:00:30]

Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

We'll see what happens. We're going to have some meetings and we'll see what happens.

Reporter ( 00:00 ):

Mr. President, you said the stock reports today were rigged.

Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Oh, yeah, I think so.

Reporter ( 00:00 ):

What sort of thing would happen with the reports?

Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

And if you look at before the election, the same kind of thing happened. And I think you'll see some very interesting information come out. But we have to have honest reports. When you look at those numbers or when you look at just before the election and then after the election, they corrected it by eight or nine hundred thousand jobs, yeah, I would say so.

Reporter ( 00:00 ):

[inaudible 00:01:03] South Korea and the United States-

Donald Trump ( 01:11 ):

We have a great relationship.

Reporter ( 01:12 ):

… [inaudible 00:01:13]?

Donald Trump ( 01:12 ):

Yeah. We have a great relationship with South Korea.

Reporter ( 01:13 ):

Are you ready? Are you open to negotiate with Brazil? The Brazilian president [inaudible 00:01:20]. Will you talk to me now?

Donald Trump ( 01:13 ):

He can talk to me anytime he wants.

Reporter ( 01:13 ):

So are you open to tariffs?

Donald Trump ( 01:13 ):

He can talk to me anytime he wants.

Reporter ( 01:13 ):

What is on the table for Brazil?

Donald Trump ( 01:32 ):

Well, we'll see what happens, but I love the people of Brazil.

Reporter ( 01:33 ):

[inaudible 00:01:37].

Donald Trump ( 01:33 ):

I love the people of Brazil.

Reporter ( 01:33 ):

So why [inaudible 00:01:43]

Donald Trump ( 01:45 ):

Because the people running Brazil did the wrong thing.

Reporter ( 01:50 ):

[inaudible 00:01:48]

( 01:50 ) Seven years from the time that you learned that people were being stolen from Mar-a-Lago, [inaudible 00:02:08]

Donald Trump ( 02:07 ):

Yeah, I don't understand your question.

Reporter ( 02:07 ):

[inaudible 00:02:08].

Donald Trump ( 02:07 ):

Say it.

Reporter ( 02:07 ):

[inaudible 00:02:09] deployed the nuclear submarines?

Donald Trump ( 02:11 ):

Oh yeah. Well we had to do that. We just have to be careful and a threat was made and we didn't think it was appropriate. So I have to be very careful. So I do that on the basis of safety for our people. A threat was made by a former president of Russia and we're going to protect our people.

Reporter ( 02:29 ):

[inaudible 00:02:30] Hillary Clinton finally be investigated for election fraud?

Donald Trump ( 02:34 ):

I hope so. I hope so. I don't know whether or not that'll happen, but I hope so.

Reporter ( 02:39 ):

Mr. President why did you fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics?

Donald Trump ( 02:42 ):

Because I think her numbers were wrong, just like I thought her numbers were wrong before the election. Days before the election, she came out with these beautiful numbers for Kamala, I guess Biden slash Kamala. And she came out with these beautiful numbers trying to get somebody else elected. Then right after the election, I think on the 15th, November 15th, she had an eight or nine hundred thousand dollar massive reduction, said she made a mistake. No, that woman's numbers aren't right.

Reporter ( 03:12 ):

Mr. president?

( 03:12 ) [inaudible 00:03:15] going to resign-

Donald Trump ( 03:15 ):

Say it.

Reporter ( 03:15 ):

[inaudible 00:03:16] Governor Kugler is set to resign [inaudible 00:03:16]

Donald Trump ( 03:16 ):

Yep, one of the governors as you know of the Federal Reserve has just announced she's resigning. I understand it was over the fact that she disagreed with somebody from her party. She disagreed with [inaudible 00:03:33]. You know who [inaudible 00:03:34] is?

Reporter ( 03:33 ):

Yeah.

Donald Trump ( 03:34 ):

She disagreed with [inaudible 00:03:36] on the interest rate. So we'll see what happens. But we just found out that I have a open spot on the Federal Reserve Board. I'm very happy about that, John.

Reporter ( 03:48 ):

Mr. President, can you give us any information on the nuclear subs and what did Medvedev say to you that made you really mad?

Donald Trump ( 03:57 ):

Well, you just have to read what he said. He was talking about nuclear. When you talk about nuclear, we have to be prepared and we're totally prepared.

Reporter ( 04:05 ):

Mr. President on the monthly jobs report, going forward, why should anyone trust the numbers? And if you're-

Donald Trump ( 04:13 ):

Well that's the big thing. You're right. No, you're right. Why should anybody trust numbers? You go back to election day, look what happened two or three days before with massive wonderful job numbers trying to get him elected or her elected, trying to get whoever the hell was running. Because you go back and they came out with numbers that were very favorable to Kamala, trying to get him elected, trying to get her elected. And then on the 15th of November or thereabouts, they had an eight or nine hundred thousand overstatement reduction right after the election. It didn't work because you know who won John? I won.

Reporter ( 04:54 ):

But here's the thing. Your supporters have had issues with these numbers. Now that you've-

Donald Trump ( 04:59 ):

I've had issues with the numbers for a long time.

Reporter ( 05:01 ):

And now that you're-

Donald Trump ( 05:01 ):

Today we're doing so well, I believe the numbers were phony just like they were before the election and there were other times. So you know what I did? I fired her.

Reporter ( 05:11 ):

Right? And so now-

Donald Trump ( 05:11 ):

And you know what? I did the right thing.

Reporter ( 05:13 ):

If any government official, any government official going forward is presenting data or information you don't like, should they fear for their job? Are you going to fire them?

Donald Trump ( 05:23 ):

I've always had a problem with these numbers. I was thinking about it this morning. Before the numbers that came out I said, "Who is the person that does these numbers?" And then they gave me stats about before the election I had a similar problem. I mean she gave out numbers that were so good for the Democrats, it was unbelievable. And then right after the election, she corrected those numbers with I think almost nine hundred thousand correction. I think nobody had ever seen anything like it. Well, today she did the same thing with the 253,000, whatever the number was. No, no, we need people that we can trust. I mean your question-

Reporter ( 06:02 ):

If someone-

( 06:02 ) Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 06:02 ):

… your question is a very good one. We need people we can trust.

Reporter ( 06:05 ):

But if-

( 06:05 ) [inaudible 00:06:06] plan to replace her with?

Donald Trump ( 06:05 ):

Who?

Reporter ( 06:05 ):

Do you know who you plan to replace her with?

Donald Trump ( 06:11 ):

I've got about three very good… I have a lot of good candidates. I will say everybody wants it. I've had more phone calls, but I have three people that-

Reporter ( 06:19 ):

Do they actually have a background in labor statistics?

Donald Trump ( 06:21 ):

I could do a long-term thing or I could do a temporary. It's a fourteen-year term.

Reporter ( 06:27 ):

Right, but do you put someone in who actually has labor statistics experience or do you put in a Republican?

Donald Trump ( 06:31 ):

I put somebody in who's going to be honest. That's all we want.

Reporter ( 06:35 ):

So are you thinking long-term or short-term?

( 06:35 ) [inaudible 00:06:36].

Donald Trump ( 06:38 ):

I have a choice. I can have four months. I could do a short-term or I can do a fourteen-year deal. So we'll see.

Reporter ( 06:44 ):

Can I ask you-

Donald Trump ( 06:44 ):

We have a lot of people, got a lot of good people around.

Reporter ( 06:46 ):

Can I ask you a construction question?

( 06:48 ) [inaudible 00:06:50] tariff rate in Switzerland? It was higher than other European-

Donald Trump ( 06:55 ):

Well, the problem with Switzerland, we have a $40 billion deficit with Switzerland. And I spoke yesterday to Switzerland. But we have a $40 billion deficit with Switzerland. That's a big deficit.

Reporter ( 07:06 ):

Question on the construction. Can I ask you a question on the construction? You say you're raising $200 million. You're donating a bunch, others are as well. Are you blocking foreigners from donating money to build that addition?

Donald Trump ( 07:19 ):

Honestly, I never even thought of it, but it doesn't matter. I'm putting up my money, but it doesn't even matter. They've wanted a ballroom at the White House and it's been very popular when we put it out.

Reporter ( 07:29 ):

So you're not ruling out that a crown prince or some European or an Asian official would give money to that?

Donald Trump ( 07:34 ):

No, I'm not looking for that. You have very strong restrictions as to who can donate and we go by the restrictions.

Reporter ( 07:39 ):

Will you give us-

Donald Trump ( 07:44 ):

I mean, it's not that much money.

Reporter ( 07:44 ):

Will you release the names of the donors?

Donald Trump ( 07:45 ):

Yeah, I'll do that.

Reporter ( 07:46 ):

Did you hear from [inaudible 00:07:48]

Donald Trump ( 07:48 ):

I didn't even start yet, by the way, but when I do, I'll release that.

Reporter ( 07:51 ):

How many donors do you think it's going to take to get the 200 million?

Donald Trump ( 07:53 ):

Maybe one, me. But-

Reporter ( 07:55 ):

You would cut that check yourself?

Donald Trump ( 07:56 ):

I would, yeah.

Reporter ( 07:59 ):

Did you talk to Steve Witkoff today from his journey to Gaza. Did you pass to Steve Witkoff?

Donald Trump ( 08:04 ):

I did. I spoke to Steve Witkoff. He had a great meeting with a lot of people and the primary meeting was on food. And he also had some other conversations that I'll tell you about later. But he had a meeting on getting the people fed and that's what we want. And I'll see you later on.

Reporter ( 08:20 ):

[inaudible 00:08:21] India. What numbers are you looking at and are you going to be having a conversation with [inaudible 00:08:28].

Donald Trump ( 08:28 ):

Well, I understand India no longer is going to be buying oil from Russia. That's what I heard. I don't know if that's right or not, but that's a good step. We'll see what happens.

Reporter ( 08:38 ):

How is your health?

( 08:39 ) Mr. President, have you spoken to Putin?

Donald Trump ( 08:40 ):

[inaudible 00:08:43].

Reporter ( 08:43 ):

On tariffs, obviously the Treasury is taking in so much money right now. Some Republicans have been pushing for tariff checks to go out. The basically idea is move the money back. Any [inaudible 00:08:53]

Donald Trump ( 08:52 ):

There are a lot of people that would like to see us do sort of a dividend to the people of our country. It's something I'd consider.

Reporter ( 08:59 ):

How much would you [inaudible 00:09:00].

Donald Trump ( 08:59 ):

I'd also, I want to pay debt, but there's a possibility I'd do a dividend.

Reporter ( 09:08 ):

[inaudible 00:09:05].

( 09:08 ) Sorry, [inaudible 00:09:09] on tariffs, obviously there's still a few dates here for some of these tariffs to possibly to reset. If you were a betting man, how many of these tariff rates can change [inaudible 00:09:17]

Donald Trump ( 09:17 ):

Not a lot. I mean, for the most part we're set. A little bit maybe, if somebody could convince us that they have a case. Like Switzerland was complaining, but we lose $40 billion a year with Switzerland. We had to do that.
