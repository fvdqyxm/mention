Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Please, the first one.

Speaker 1 ( 00:00 ):

Yes, sir. First we have for your signature, five official designations of special envoys. The first is Mr. Steve Witkoff, who's actually in the room, to be your Middle East envoy.

Donald Trump ( 00:23 ):

Where is Steve?

Steve Witkoff ( 00:26 ):

Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 00:27 ):

Steve Witkoff, everybody. He's done a great job in the Middle East, really great. But we'll see how it all turns out. It's complex, but I think he's going to do very well. [inaudible 00:00:39].

Speaker 1 ( 00:39 ):

Next, we have Mauricio Claver-Corone to be your special envoy to Latin America, sir.

Donald Trump ( 00:54 ):

Okay, good man. Okay.

Speaker 1 ( 00:54 ):

Thank you, sir. Next, we have retired general Keith Kellogg to be your special envoy on Russian- Ukraine issues.

Donald Trump ( 01:03 ):

We've made a lot of progress on Russia-Ukraine. We'll see what happens, but a lot of progress has been made. We've got to stop that ridiculous war. Okay.

Speaker 1 ( 01:22 ):

Thank you, sir. Next, we have a designation of Richard Grenell, Ric Grenell to be your envoy for special missions.

Donald Trump ( 01:31 ):

I sent him to California to turn on the water. We turned it on. It was not easy, because we had to go through a lot of environmentalists that are causing a lot of problems. And we have billions of gallons of water. It was on three days ago, you probably saw. It should have gotten a lot of press, but it didn't get much. All we're doing is giving Los Angeles and the entire state of California virtually unlimited water, which they could have done five years ago, which I told them they should do. But the environmentalists stopped them.

( 02:01 ) And we opened it and we did it regardless of the state. And now the state seems to be very happy. I spoke with Gavin Newsom, and he is very happy. I almost called him by the other name, didn't I? My little nickname for him. But I think they're all happy. They have a lot of water in California. Too bad we didn't have it about two months ago, right?

Speaker 2 ( 02:27 ):

Mr. President, Rick Burnell-

Donald Trump ( 02:28 ):

By the way, that was a big move. I don't know if you saw the pictures that were released of the water pouring down from the Pacific Northwest in Canada and lots of other places. And it's a pretty amazing sight.

Speaker 2 ( 02:44 ):

Mr. President, Rick Burnell had a big Friday trip as well.

Donald Trump ( 02:49 ):

He had a very big Friday trip, you're right. We'll talk about that. He's a good man, Rick.

Speaker 1 ( 02:54 ):

Lastly, sir, we have a designation of Mark Burnett as your special envoy to the United Kingdom.

Donald Trump ( 03:00 ):

You know who Mark Burnett is, huh?

Speaker 2 ( 03:01 ):

[inaudible 00:03:03].

Donald Trump ( 03:03 ):

He should be good. He certainly had done a great job. A friend of mine and a very talented guy. We are have very talented people working for us. I'll hold that one up because Mark gets so much television, we'll hold it up, right? He'll be thrilled to see it. He's going to do a good job.

Speaker 1 ( 03:22 ):

Thank you, sir. Next, your administration has smashed records for appointing large numbers of highly qualified, capable people at all levels, the federal government. These are 28 sub-cabinet level officials being appointed to a number of different departments and agencies. Some of them are quite important positions like departmental general councils. But these are people who have been pre-vetted and have received your approval previously.

Donald Trump ( 03:48 ):

Yep. Very good. Okay.

Speaker 1 ( 03:58 ):

Thank you, sir. Next, this is an executive order. This charges your Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent and your Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, to begin a process that will hopefully, result in the creation of an American Sovereign Wealth Fund.

Donald Trump ( 04:14 ):

It's a very exciting event. We're going to have a Sovereign Wealth Fund, which we've never had. We have a lot of things that create wealth, and you've seen that over the last two weeks. I think we've created more wealth. Other people have created de-wealth. The people, my predecessors, are creating a lot of wealth. Scott, maybe you'd like to say something about it. And I'd ask also, Howard to say something about it.

Scott Bessent ( 04:41 ):

Yes, sir. This is very exciting. We are going to stand this thing up within the next 12 months. We are going to monetize the assets side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people. We're going to put the assets to work. And I think it's going to be very exciting. We're going to study best practices that's done around the world. It'll be a combination of liquid assets, assets that we have in this country, as we work to bring them out for the American people.

Howard Lutnick ( 05:18 ):

The extraordinary size and scale of the U.S. government and the business it does with companies should create value for American citizens. If we are going to buy 2 billion COVID vaccines, maybe we should have some warrants and some equity in these companies, and have that grow for the help of the American people. So I bring all these things together. I think Scott and I will create an amazing Sovereign Wealth Fund for you, sir.

Donald Trump ( 05:49 ):

So other countries have Sovereign Wealth Funds and they're much smaller countries and they're not the United States. We have tremendous potential in this country. Tremendous. You're seeing that what's happened just in a short period of time. And as an example, TikTok, we're going to be doing something perhaps with TikTok and perhaps not. If we make the right deal, we'll do it, otherwise we won't. But I have the right to do that. And we might put that in the Sovereign Wealth Fund, whatever we make. Or if we do a partnership with very wealthy people, a lot of options. But we could put that as an example in the fund.

( 06:24 ) And we have a lot of other things that we could put in the fund. And I think in a short period of time we'd have one of the biggest funds. And some of them are pretty large, I must tell you. Like the Saudi Arabia fund is on the large side, but eventually we'll catch it. But we're going to create a lot of wealth for the fund. And I think it's about time that this country had a Sovereign Wealth Fund. And these two gentlemen and some others are going to work with them very closely, and they'll be heading it up and they're going to do a great job. Two highly respected people that have done unbelievably well in the world, in the real world. So that's a big deal, huh?

Scott Bessent ( 07:02 ):

Yes, sir. I think it's going to create value and be of great strategic importance.

Speaker 2 ( 07:10 ):

Mr. President, why is it important for Elon Musk to have access to the payment systems at Treasury?

Donald Trump ( 07:15 ):

Well, he's got access only to letting people go that he thinks are no good, if we agree with him. And it's only if we agree with him. He's a very talented guy from the standpoint of management and costs. And we put him in charge of seeing what he can do with certain groups and certain numbers. The numbers, some of the numbers are horrible what he's found. A hundred, think of it, a hundred million dollars on condoms to Hamas, condoms to Hamas. And many other things that are frankly even more ridiculous. And they're finding tremendous waste, really waste more than anything else, I think you could say. Probably fraud and abuse could be added to it, the more standard waste, fraud and abuse. But they're finding tremendous amounts of really bad things, bad spending.

( 08:14 ) You've been reading about, you've been writing about some of it, frankly. And some of the things that they've been doing is just terrible. Elon can't do and won't do anything without our approval. And we'll give him the approval where appropriate. Where not appropriate, we won't. But he reports in and it's something that he feels very strongly about. And I'm impressed, because he's running, obviously a big company. He has nothing to do… If there's a conflict that we won't let him get near it. But he does have a good natural instinct. He's got a team of very talented people. We're trying to shrink government. And he can probably shrink it as well as anybody else, if not better. Where we think there's a conflict or there's a problem, we won't let him go near it.

Donald Trump ( 09:00 ):

… but he has some very good ideas and we have a lot of very other talented people also. We're bringing in the most talented people in the world.

( 09:07 ) By the way, we just unrelated, but we have two of the most talented people in the world, the legendary Rupert Murdoch and Larry Ellison. So they are two legends in business, publishing and probably every other … Rupert is, Larry, pretty much in a class by himself, right? I mean, although you may have a couple of bucks more, I don't know. But Rupert is in a class by himself. He's an amazing guy, and Larry's Larry. Larry's one of the most serious players anywhere in the world, so it's an honor to have you.

( 09:40 ) This has nothing to do with you people, but they're here and I thought it would be appropriate. I'm sure you didn't recognize them. If we're all going crazy, they say, "What are they doing here?"

Speaker 1 ( 09:50 ):

Thank you, sir.

Speaker 3 ( 09:50 ):

Mr. President, on the tariffs, is there any chance that Canada or China could also get out of the tariffs after you struck a deal with Mexico today?

Donald Trump ( 09:57 ):

Well, nobody's out … With Mexico, we had a great talk with Mexico and we had the … President Sheinbaum is a woman. I like her very much. We've had good relationships, but we have to stop fentanyl from coming in, whether I like somebody or not, and we have to stop the illegal aliens from coming in. I think we've lost 200,000 people on average a year for many years. Much higher than the 100,000, could be even closer to 300,000.

( 10:27 ) And they've agreed to put in 10, 000 soldiers permanently, like forever, 10,000 soldiers at their side of the border and stop fentanyl and illegal aliens from coming into our country. They have a big incentive to do. Other than that, we've agreed to talk and consider various other things. We haven't agreed on tariffs yet, and maybe we will, maybe we won't, but we have a very good relationship.

( 10:54 ) I also spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, and we had a good talk in the morning, but I did ask him a couple of questions, like banks aren't allowed to do business in Canada. Canada is very tough. We are not treated well by Canada and we have to be treated well. Banks are not, as an example, allowed … Did you know that, that American banks are not allowed to do business in Canada? Can you believe that?

( 11:21 ) And that's one of many things. And we talked about it and I think we'll win most of the subjects, but for some reason, a lot of things have been very unfair with Canada. I noticed that in the first term, you deal with people and after a while you begin to realize, like you learn that Larry Ellison is very tough to do business with. He's a very tough guy. I mean, I'm sure you're shocked to hear that, but Canada is very tough. They're very, very tough to do business with and we can't let them take advantage of the US. They don't take our agricultural product, for the most part. They don't take our cars, they make cars, but they basically don't take our cars.

( 12:03 ) And look, I think we're going to have another good conversation today. We're actually speaking at three o'clock again, but we don't need them to make our cars. We don't need them to give us lumber. We don't need them for agricultural products because we have all the agriculture we need. They don't take our agricultural product for the most part, our milk and dairy, et cetera. A little bit they do, but not much. We take theirs. And as far as cars are concerned, they took in a big percentage, almost 19% of the market. And I wouldn't mind making our cars in the United States so we have a problem there. I'd like to make our cars in the US. We don't need Canada to make our cars.

( 12:44 ) With that being said, we're going to have another call at three o'clock. We had a call this morning, it was a pretty good call I'd say. The call with Mexico went very well in the sense that they're very strong now on the border. They're going to put soldiers there, actually, their best military soldiers, and they're going to be at the border. 10,000, that's a lot of soldiers. And they want to protect it also. They don't want people running through Mexico, coming through Mexico to come into our country. So they're going to do that.

( 13:16 ) And then we're going to talk about other things over the next 30 days. We're going to have Scott Howard and Marco, Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, lead the delegation, and we're going to have a big negotiation with Mexico. I'll be involved too, and President Sheinbaum will be involved, to see whether or not we can work something out on the tariffs.

Speaker 4 ( 13:38 ):

What about China, sir?

Donald Trump ( 13:41 ):

China, we'll be speaking to China probably over the next 24 hours.

Speaker 4 ( 13:47 ):

On fentanyl in China, President Trump-

Donald Trump ( 13:48 ):

We don't want fentanyl coming into our country. Now we had another big thing, speaking of China, China's involved with the Panama Canal. They won't be for long, and that's the way it has to be. Marco just got back, as you know, he's in the process of coming back, I guess he's almost back by now. And he had a very long conversation with the leader of Panama, the respected man, and some others, the entire leadership group.

( 14:18 ) And we're trying to work a deal of the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal was given foolishly years ago to … It shouldn't been happened, years ago to Panama, like Jimmy Carter and the group. We lost 38,000 people building the Panama Canal. One of the great wonders of the world. It's the biggest job we've ever built. The biggest project we've ever built in this country, dollar-wise and every other way. 38,000 people died, Americans, all men, just about, laborers and construction people. They went to Panama. The mosquito got them, between mosquito and snakes we lost 38,000 people.

( 15:06 ) It was the most expensive project ever built by the United States. The biggest, most expensive project we ever built, 110 years ago. If you bring it up to now, it would've been the equivalent of $2 trillion. The most expensive we ever built, and we gave it away for $1. We gave it away essentially for nothing. And we either want it back or we're going to get something very strong, or we're going to take it back. And China will be dealt with.

( 15:44 ) And we didn't give that to China, we gave it to Panama. We shouldn't have given it to Panama. But Panama, as you know, has violated the agreement, totally violated the agreement. So that's in the process right now. But they did have a very good meeting with the head of Panama.

Speaker 4 ( 15:59 ):

In addition to tariffs on China, could you say your current thinking about whether China should be forced to pay reparations, both for fentanyl deaths and the million COVID [inaudible 00:16:10]?

Donald Trump ( 16:10 ):

No, I haven't talked about that, but they do have tariffs. The amount of money that was lost, and most importantly, the lives lost because of COVID, is not something that anybody could ever even imagine. It's probably $60 trillion, that all the countries in the world don't have $60 trillion. The amount of death and the amount of destruction and the amount of money lost is probably $60 trillion. I had it figured by people about three months ago. It's just figured out. Nobody knows what the real number is, but it's almost an infinite number, the damage done.

( 16:53 ) No, but I have not discussed that. What I have discussed is we'll have some good meetings with China. We have meetings planned and we'll see what happens. But that was just an opening salvo. If we can't make a deal with China, then the tariffs will be very, very substantial. Okay, I'm going to sign this one.

Speaker 1 ( 17:13 ):

Sir, you've obviously made Making America Healthy Again a key priority of this administration. A key component of that is obviously heart health. This is a ceremonial proclamation declaring the month of February to be National Heart Month.

Donald Trump ( 17:27 ):

Okay. I hear we're doing very well with nominations. We'll see, but it looks like we're doing very well with nominations.

Speaker 5 ( 17:34 ):

Mr. President, have you been involved with calling senators who had some concerns about Tulsi Gabbard or RFK?

Donald Trump ( 17:39 ):

Yes.

Speaker 5 ( 17:40 ):

You have?

Donald Trump ( 17:41 ):

Yeah. I've gotten great response, and they want to do what's right and we've had a good response. I think we'll do well. We have great people, people like this. We have great, great people coming in. I'd like to say the best ever recruited for government. I think we have the finest

Donald Trump ( 18:00 ):

… finest people ever recruited for government.

Journalists ( 18:02 ):

Will it take an act of congress to-

Donald Trump ( 18:04 ):

And you know what? You're starting to see that because we've done more in two weeks than Biden's done in four, five years, six years. They could be here, between him and Obama, you add it up, okay, we've done more in two weeks than they've done in 12 years.

Journalists ( 18:19 ):

Will it take an act of Congress to do away with USAID or do you believe you have [inaudible 00:18:24]-

Donald Trump ( 18:24 ):

I don't know. I don't think so. Not when it comes to fraud. If there's fraud, these people are lunatics, and if it comes to fraud, you wouldn't have an act of Congress, and I'm not sure that you would anyway. But we just want to do the right thing. It's something that should have been done a long time ago. It went crazy during the Biden administration. They went totally crazy, what they were doing. And the money they were giving to people that shouldn't be getting it and to agencies and others that shouldn't be getting. It was a shame. So a tremendous fraud. But we'll be doing a report. We'll be giving you that report at the appropriate time. Yeah.

Journalists ( 19:01 ):

In the first term though, USAID was something that you liked in some respects.

Donald Trump ( 19:05 ):

I love the concept of it.

Journalists ( 19:06 ):

[inaudible 00:19:07] as a program.

Donald Trump ( 19:07 ):

Sure, I love the concept, but they turned out to be radical left lunatics. And the concept of it is good, but it's all about the people.

Journalists ( 19:16 ):

Mr. President, you said you also want to impose tariffs on the EU. What kind of tariffs are you talking about [inaudible 00:19:22]-

Donald Trump ( 19:22 ):

Well, we have massive deficits with the European Union. Massive, like $350 billion if you can believe it. They don't take our farm product, they don't take our cars. They don't take almost anything. But we take their cars. We have millions of cars coming in; BMW and Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen and just so many different cars. And we don't do anything about that. And we don't charge them tariffs. They make it impossible to sell cars in the European Union. They make it very difficult.

( 19:55 ) Agricultural product, they actually don't take it. And they have a lot of excuses. Some of them are the pesticides and the different chemicals used. And Bobby Kennedy actually is looking at that very seriously, 'cause maybe it's not necessary to use all of that. We want to be the healthiest country and we're not. We spend more money on food than anybody else in terms of its creation, but we're not the healthiest country. So maybe there is something to the fact that we shouldn't be using so much chemical and maybe that'll stop. But Bobby Kennedy is the one, because he is not a believer in all of the things we have done and neither are the Europeans. So we'll see what happens. But they use it as an excuse not to buy our product.

( 20:40 ) And [inaudible 00:20:40], I asked a couple of the leaders, I don't want to use names but, "How many Chevrolets or Fords do you see in the middle of Munich?" And the answer is none. Because they don't take any cars. They don't take anything. So the European has abused the United States for years and they can't do that. And they want to make a deal. Let me tell you. In all cases, they all want to make deals. There's nobody that doesn't want to make deals. They've been abusers and they want to make deals. So we'll see about that.

( 21:11 ) But we'll have, I think, some very fair… All we want is a fair deal. And you know there's a word, reciprocal. I'd go right now, reciprocal tariffs on everybody. Because many of the countries that you feel so horrible about, the way they're being treated by Trump, you're saying, "Oh, President Trump is so terrible to them." Well, they charge us tariffs. European Union has a VAT tax, which is through the roof, okay? It's a similar thing, similar to a tariff. It's a VAT, and they have it and it's numbers like you wouldn't believe.

( 21:44 ) And Canada, I told you about the banks and I told you they charge us. And people don't say that. They don't like to say it. Just like they don't like to say that I opened up the water for California. It's a great thing. It's too bad they didn't do it themselves. I had to do it and it was not easy. We did it a very rough way and I didn't like to do it a rough way. We shouldn't have to do it a rough way.

( 22:07 ) But a lot of these countries that we're talking about, they're our so-called allies, but they don't treat us well. And just like I got $420 billion and now it's actually over $600 billion, the Secretary General of NATO came in two weeks ago and he said, "It was a miracle." When Trump came in, when President Trump came into NATO, I got… He said it was $ 636 billion. By saying to them, "No, you have to pay and if you don't pay, we're not going to be there for you." Somebody has to say it and they paid. And it was a large amount of money.

( 22:43 ) And one of the problems we have with the Russia-Ukraine situation is that. We wanted to see some equalization, because we're in for close to $300 billion and they're in for $200 billion less. Why are they in for less? Because Biden never asked them for money. He never said you got to pay. He never did. All he did is hand out money. So we're talking with them right now and we're actually working some deals right now. So we have some guarantees and some other things to keep that whole situation to go, really going, I mean, going.

( 23:23 ) We're telling Ukraine they have very valuable rare earth. We want what we put up to go in terms of a guarantee. We want a guarantee. We're handing money hand over fist. We're giving them equipment. European is not keeping up with us. They should equalize. Look, we have an ocean in between, they don't. It's more important for them than it is for us, but they're way below us in terms of money and they should be paying at least equal. They should really be paying much more than us, but let's say equal to us. And they are billions and billions of dollars below. So we're looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they're going to secure what we're giving them with their rare earth and other things.

Journalists ( 24:11 ):

Mr. President, [inaudible 00:24:12] a deal with Mexico this morning, was that partially related to the market reaction and a criticism from Mr. Murdoch's own newspaper? He called it the dumbest trade war on the editorial page on Saturday.

Donald Trump ( 24:24 ):

I'm going to have to talk to him.

Journalists ( 24:25 ):

Has the market reaction or concern about-

Donald Trump ( 24:29 ):

I've been right over the Wall Street Journal many times. I will tell you that. I don't agree with him on some things. No, not only is it not them. You're going to see, you're going to see every single one of those countries is dying to make a deal. You know why? Because they're ripping us off really badly and the United States is tired of been ripping… We were just being ripped off. And that's why we have $36 trillion in debt. We have it for a reason because we make bad deals with everybody and we don't allow that anymore. So the Wall Street Journal is wrong. Very simply, every single country that you're writing about right now is dying to make a deal, because the deals they have right now are so good and so good for them and so profitable for them.

( 25:15 ) You didn't know that Canada didn't allow our banks, you didn't know all of these different things. And I think in the end you're going to see that either very, very substantial tariffs are going to be paid by them or they're going to make some kind of a deal.

Journalists ( 25:30 ):

Sir, on-

( 25:30 ) [inaudible 00:25:31] this morning, or did Mexican President Sheinbaum-

Donald Trump ( 25:33 ):

Did what?

Journalists ( 25:35 ):

Did you blink this morning?

Donald Trump ( 25:35 ):

There was no blinking, no, she's a wonderful woman. But she did agree to 10,000 soldiers on the border. I would say that's a lot. Would you say that's pretty good? 10,000 soldiers on the border.

Journalists ( 25:45 ):

Sir, just-

Donald Trump ( 25:46 ):

And the 10,000 soldiers are going to keep illegal aliens out. And they're going to keep them out, seriously out, otherwise they're going to have a big penalty. Mexico is going to be penalized. They're not going to come through Mexico anymore and they're not going to let the fentanyl come in from China. And China, hopefully, is going to stop sending us fentanyl. And if they're not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher.

Journalists ( 26:09 ):

Sir, just to clarify, when you said about Ukraine earlier, the rare earths, is that something you want them to give, the rare earths, to the United States?

Donald Trump ( 26:17 ):

Yeah, yeah.

Journalists ( 26:18 ):

Okay.

Donald Trump ( 26:18 ):

I want to have security of rare earth. We're putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earth and I want security of the rare earth and they're willing to do it.

Journalists ( 26:31 ):

Sir, you mentioned earlier about Elon Musk-

( 26:31 ) Mr. President, on Canada, when you talk to Justin Trudeau again, is there anything he can give you at 3:00 PM when you talk again to also-

Donald Trump ( 26:38 ):

I don't know.

Journalists ( 26:39 ):

… secure a pause-

Donald Trump ( 26:39 ):

I don't know.

Journalists ( 26:39 ):

… like you said with Mexico?

Donald Trump ( 26:40 ):

I don't know. We have big deficits with Canada like we do with all countries. I mean, I look at some of the deals made. I say, "Who the hell made these deals that's so bad?" But with Canada, I have a talk with him and you maybe know or maybe not, we're going to meet again or talk again at three o'clock, right after my next meeting,

( 26:59 ) …

Donald Trump ( 27:01 ):

And we'll see what happens. I can't tell you what's going to happen.

Speaker 6 ( 27:06 ):

Anything on the dates he mentioned that he could agree to, to change your mind on the terrorists?

Donald Trump ( 27:08 ):

Well, we can always… Look what I'd like to see, Canada become our 51st state. We give them protection, military protection. We don't need them to build our cars, I'd rather see Detroit or South Carolina or any one of our… Tennessee, any one of our states build the cars. They could do it very easily. We don't need them for the cars. We don't need them for lumber. We don't need them for anything. We don't need them for energy, we have more energy than they do. We don't need them for energy.

( 27:37 ) So I say, why are we doing this? Why are we willing to lose between $100 billion and $200 billion a year? We don't need them. As a state, it's different. As a state, it's much different and there are no tariffs. So I'd love to see that. But some people say that would be a long shot. If people wanted to play the game right, it would be a hundred percent certain that they'd become a state. But a lot of people don't like to play the game because they don't have a threshold of pain. And there would be some pain, but not a lot. The pain would be really theirs. So we're going to meet again by phone at three o'clock and we'll let you know-

Speaker 7 ( 28:21 ):

On Israel, President Trump, you're prepared to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu-

Donald Trump ( 28:25 ):

Coming in tomorrow.

Speaker 7 ( 28:25 ):

Yes. You've mentioned in the past you're concerned about Israel being too small geographically, would you support annexation of parts of the West Bank by Israel?

Donald Trump ( 28:33 ):

Well, I'm not going to talk about that. It certainly is a small… It's a small country in terms of land. See this pen, this wonderful pen. My desk is the Middle East, and this pen, the top of the pen, that's Israel. That's not good, right? It's a pretty big difference. I use that as an analogy. It's pretty accurate actually. It's a pretty small piece of land, and it's amazing that they've been able to do what they've been able to do. When you think about it, there's a lot of good, smart brainpower. But it is a very small piece of land. No question about it.

Speaker 8 ( 29:09 ):

Mr. President, you said earlier that Elon Musk is doing everything with your say so. So is there everything that he has done thus far going to all the agencies, shutting off access, getting access to federal payments, that all has… You're okay with all of that?

Donald Trump ( 29:22 ):

For the most part, yeah. I mean, if there was something that didn't have my okay, I'd let you know about it really fast.

Speaker 8 ( 29:29 ):

And you said there's some areas where you wouldn't let him work because he has conflicts of interest.

Donald Trump ( 29:32 ):

If there was a… No, I haven't seen that. And he would know not to do it. So we haven't had that yet. But if there was a conflict, we wouldn't let him work in that area.

Speaker 8 ( 29:41 ):

You said earlier, on the Department of Panama that they were going to make a deal, or the US is going to take it. How long do they have to make that sort of deal? And are you still meeting on the table-

Donald Trump ( 29:50 ):

We're going to meet with Panama on Friday at about 3:30 in the afternoon by phone. And maybe there'll be some representatives here or there. But we're going to be talking to Panama on Friday, essentially. And they've agreed to certain things, but I'm not happy with it.

Speaker 6 ( 30:11 ):

On the Middle East, Mr. president, if I may. Do you still have doubts that the ceasefire will hold?

Donald Trump ( 30:17 ):

On what?

Speaker 6 ( 30:18 ):

On the Middle East, do you think the ceasefire will hold?

Donald Trump ( 30:20 ):

I have no assurances that it'll hold. I mean, I've seen people brutalized. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. No, I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold. Steve, you might want to say something about that, Steve Whitcomb?

Steve Whitcomb ( 30:34 ):

It's holding so far, and we're certainly hopeful. And that's the President's direction, get the hostages out, save lives, and come to hopefully a peaceful settlement of it all. So, so far it's holding.

Speaker 8 ( 30:50 ):

Mr. President on a different topic. Questionnaires have been going on to FBI agents across the country who were involved potentially in the investigation. Do you believe anyone involved at any level should be fired, sir?

Donald Trump ( 31:02 ):

Well, I think the FBI was a very corrupt institution, and I'm a victim of it in a true sense. I was able to beat it, but other people have been treated horribly. I think the FBI has a great… Had a great reputation. I think its reputation was really damaged badly, as is DOJ. Look at what they've done in terms of weaponization. Look at what they've done to a political opponent. Probably got me elected by what they did or… Think I was doing well anyway, but they might've got me elected.

( 31:36 ) But you know what? We have to have pristine, beautiful, perfect law enforcement. And what we want to do, Cash is the one to do it. He's the one guy that is going to do it. We have to bring the reputation of the FBI, we have to bring the fact of the FBI back to what it could be, not even to what it was, even better than it ever was. Because who would've thought that the FBI could have been corrupted like they were corrupted? Who would've thought that would've happened? Who would've thought they would've been used to go after political opponents essentially? But me being the number one and so many other things beyond that. And they've been hurt very badly, and we'll see what happens. But Cash is the one to do it and I hear he is doing very well. Cash will straighten it out. We have great confidence that we can make the FBI great again.

( 32:29 ) Okay, one or two more and we'll be done.

Speaker 7 ( 32:30 ):

Tulsi Gabbard's nomination is-

Donald Trump ( 32:30 ):

Say it?

Speaker 7 ( 32:32 ):

Tulsi Gabbard [inaudible 00:32:34].

Donald Trump ( 32:34 ):

Yeah, I think Tulsi is going to be doing okay. I'm not sure. I can't guarantee anything, but she's liked by so many people, especially people in the military and law enforcement.

Speaker 7 ( 32:44 ):

She has a little bit of trouble with some senators over her thoughts on Edward Snowden. I know with Snowden, you've mentioned in the past, you're thinking about pardoning him. Are you still, and what do you think about that?

Donald Trump ( 32:53 ):

No, I don't talk about it right now. People feel very differently. Some people think he should be pardoned and some people think it would be a terrible thing to do. But I don't get involved in that.

Speaker 8 ( 33:04 ):

Mr. President, what are you discussing with Mr. Murdoch and [inaudible 00:33:09]

Donald Trump ( 33:09 ):

Just respect. I have great respect for Rupert Murdoch. I disagree with him a lot of times with the Wall Street Journal, but that's all right. We've disagreed before. And I'm sure they didn't have any idea what they were talking about because already you see what's happening. Look at Colombia, look at what happened with that. Everybody said that with Colombia it was going to be a disaster. In one hour, everything was settled. You know why? Tariffs. Tariffs. Without tariffs, they wouldn't have been the same way. They would not have treated me the way they treated me, which was extremely nicely.

( 33:49 ) And I don't want to use countries, I don't want to use names, but tariffs are very powerful both economically and in getting everything else you want. Tariffs for us, nobody can compete with us because we're the pot of gold. But if we don't keep winning and keep doing well, we won't be the pot of gold. And then tariffs won't be so good for us. But when you're the pot of gold, the tariffs are very good. They're very powerful, and they're going to make our country very rich again. Thank you very much everybody.

Speaker 9 ( 34:18 ):

Donald Trump ( 34:18 ):

Speaker 9 ( 34:22 ):

Donald Trump ( 34:24 ):

Speaker 6 ( 34:32 ):

Thank you guys.

Speaker 9 ( 34:32 ):

Guys, thank you guys. Thank you guys, lets go.

Donald Trump ( 34:32 ):
