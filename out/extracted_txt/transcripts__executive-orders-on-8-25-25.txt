Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Well, thank you very much. It's a very important day for many reasons. We've had a lot of important days lately, but this is a meeting and a group of people that are doing an unbelievable job in a thing called crime. And in particular, violent crime. Today we're going to be discussing it, and I watched as a very incompetent mayor from Chicago, said, "Well, what do they know? They only arrested nine people." I said, "Nine people? We didn't arrest nine people." We actually arrested a total of well over a thousand people. We took hundreds of guns away from young kids that were throwing them around like it was candy. We apprehended scores of illegal aliens. We seized dozens of illegal firearms. There have been zero murders. It sounds sort of terrible to say, it's embarrassing, I did this over the weekend. I'm making a speech and I acted like I was so proud as I said we've had zero murders in the last week.

( 01:04 ) And some of these people were from foreign countries. They said, "That doesn't sound so good." And I said, "Well, it doesn't sound good. But Washington was the most dangerous place in this country." And now, you know what? It's probably the safest place in our country. Everyone's starting to come here. The restaurants now, you can't get in. Many of them closed because they couldn't open with crime. Everybody before me is happy what I'm doing, most of you won't say that because you're radical left. The newspapers are so dishonest. The press is totally dishonest, but that's all right, we've gotten used to it. And we won in a landslide, so they obviously lost their power. I mean, it's impossible to imagine that when you get 97% negative stories, purposely negative stories, even though you've done 97% positive things, that you could win an election in a landslide winning all seven.

( 01:54 ) Think of it, all seven swing states winning by the popular vote by millions of votes. We had a fantastic… The best this year, districts, out of 3,000 districts, I guess we won, 3,500, we won 2,750 and they won 500. And that's, to me, the best of all. And we had tremendous, in every way, the election, and it's hard to believe you can do that when you have a corrupt media. But you are, many of you are corrupt, and it's nothing we can do about it. But we keep winning and we're going to keep winning. And this whole story on crime is incredible that the Democrats wouldn't be with us. So the mayor of Chicago, I watched him this morning, he said, "Trump doesn't know what he's talking about. He only apprehended nine people." Well, number one, that's false. Literally it's thousands, we'll get into that.

( 02:48 ) But more importantly than anything, we took guns away, we have some of the worst career professionals out of the country already. They've been taken out of the country and some are in solid confinement because these were killers. We arrested some very bad people. And in the last 11 days, again, I hate to say it because it sounds so ridiculous, but in the last 11 days we've had no murders. And that's the first time that's taken place in years, actually years. We always have a murder a week. They call it a murder a week. You come here from Iowa, you come here from Indiana, you come here from Idaho, because you're so proud of your country, you love your country, and then you get murdered, your son gets murdered, your daughter gets murdered, you get murdered. See, the media, you get murdered. Many of you have been mugged in Washington you just don't want to talk about it.

( 03:36 ) And I know that every time I do this with you, you almost everything, but every time I do this with you, you people are saying to yourselves, he's right, he's right. And then you write a negative story. But we are doing an incredible job. The people behind me are amazing. We're working very well with the Washington Police, as you know. The DC National Guard is unbelievable. We're also getting tremendous help from Secret Service and we are at a point where Washington is booming again. People are pouring in like we haven't seen for years. Nobody wanted to come here. They didn't want to come here and get murdered. I have a friend of mine who has a very successful son and I said, "Where is your son going to be this weekend?" He said, "He's going to Washington with his friends." I said, "Really?" "Yeah, he's wanted to do it for four years, but he couldn't do it because it was so unsafe." And he's a tough kid too. It's so unsafe.

( 04:32 ) And he ended up staying and staying three nights, going out to restaurants all three nights. He said it was so beautiful, so peaceful because all the criminals are either arrested or they're hiding and we're finding the ones that are hiding. So I want to thank Pam Bondi. I want to thank our vice president. I want to thank everybody standing behind me because they are really… Gatti, you've been unbelievable by the way. They have done an unbelievable job. They're working 24 hours a day. And Washington DC is now in great shape. I'm going to be working with Clark Construction, which is by far your biggest construction company. And we're going to also beautify Washington. We're going to rip down the broken medians, fix them, we're going to put asphalt on the roads. We're not ripping them apart like these stupid people do. They rip a road down to the dirt, and then they spend five years in building the new one and then it starts settling. The whole thing is so crazy. And they'll spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a road. I'll spend about $2, and it'll look better.

( 05:35 ) So we're going to be replacing medians, we're going to be replacing much of the asphalt in the road in the city, which is in bad shape. We have great stripers, we have great contractors, but we have to let them do the thing. The Congress had said that they'll give us whatever money is needed to fix up the capital, this is the capital. And we're not going to spend a lot, it's going to go fast and it will be spotless. And we want it spotless for the World Cup and for the Olympics. You saw the World Cup was here the other day, and come to think of it, there's your trophy for the World Cup. In fact, it's solid gold. That's actually solid gold. So heavy that some of the people in this room wouldn't be able to lift that. I think what I'm going to do is place it right above the angel, right over there. That's solid goal too. We're going to put it right up there. Look at that, there's a solid gold trophy. They know how to get to me. I like the angel better to be honest with you. So we're going to sign and then we'll take a few questions and we'll tell you how good a job we're doing. And we want to go from here to other places. But I was telling some of the people that in a certain way you really want to be asked to go. I hate to barge in on a city and then be treated horribly by corrupt politicians and bad politicians, like a guy like Pritzker, he ought to spend more time in the gym, actually. The guy is a disaster. Gavin Newsom is a disaster. When we went, we saved Los Angeles. You wouldn't have been able to have the Olympics in Los Angeles. You're barely able to have it now, they did lose 25,000 houses to a fire that should have never occurred because they didn't let the water come down from the Pacific Northwest, which you guys don't want to write about. I had to break into the water supply to let the water down.

( 07:23 ) And even now, we want more. We can have much more. It's less than half of what should be coming in. I don't know, they have a political thing about it. It's like the craziest thing I've ever seen. But I don't like going to a town, city, place, a state and then be criticized by some corrupt or incompetent governor where crime is rampant. Take a look at DC, crime was rampant. It was at the all-time worst. It got really bad during the Biden four years. And then I have a mayor stand up and say how crime has reached a thirty-year low. Thirty-year low? People are being killed left and right. And it's not a thirty-year low. Think of it, so for 11 days there have been no murders, the record goes back years where that's happened. They haven't seen that happen in years.

( 08:11 ) And then people stand up and instead of thanking us, which they should do, and she's not that bad, she's better than most, but you know have people… I watched in Illinois, Chicago, Illinois is a disaster. I have property there. It's a disaster what's going on in Chicago. And you get a Pritzker guy, he's violating our rights. I think this is another men in women's sports thing. I think this is one of those, they call them 80-20 issues. I call them 90-7-3. I think the Democrats better get smart, and politically I hope they don't. But actually, in terms of love for the country, I hope they do because it would be good to work together. So I'm thinking about… When I have some slob like Pritzker criticizing us before we even go there, I made the statement that next should be Chicago, because as you all know, Chicago is a killing field right now.

( 09:03 ) And they don't acknowledge it. And they say, "We don't need him. Freedom. Freedom. He's a dictator. He's a dictator." A lot of people are saying maybe we'd like a dictator. I don't like a dictator. I'm not a dictator. I'm a man with great common sense and I'm a smart person. And when I see what's happening to our cities and then you send in troops. Instead of being praised, they're saying, "You're trying to take over the republic." These people are sick. But I'm really saying, and I say this to all of you. In a certain way, we should wait to be asked because they have cities that are so out of control. So we go in and fix it, they take the full credit for it and they go out and say… I heard it this morning. They're saying how well they've done over the last 10-day period. That they set record lows.

( 09:52 ) They don't say that we're there with very tough people by the way. They have to pass the toughness test otherwise they're not working for us. And we're allowed to do that now according to the United States Supreme Court decision, now they have to pass a toughness test. If they're not tough, we don't want them for this job. They might be great for other jobs, but not for this job because they're respected. You saw the gang of kids, they were all huddled up, and a group of soldiers walked up. They never even got over. Those kids ran back to their homes or wherever the hell they came from, they were gone. You have… This is one of the safest cities right now in the world, as crazy as that sounds, and it took seven days. It took really three days but we're now in our 11th day.

( 10:34 ) So I want to thank you. So we had all of these things, 439 illegal alien criminals have been removed and we have six known gang members, some of the worst leaders of gangs anywhere in the country. MS-13 and Tren de Aragua with two missing children that have been recovered. They thought they were gone. We brought them back to the family. The family started crying. They couldn't believe that they saw their child again. 49 homeless encampments have been removed. We have the head of South Korea coming in in a little while, the president, and he drives down the street, already, his people have told me, he said, "What happened? It's so clean. We always came here, it was filthy dirty with homeless and papers all over the road." That's the other thing, those roads are swept immaculate. But they're going to be much better in a few months when we put a topping on them, they're going to look like they're brand new and we'll get rid of those rusty old medians that have been crashed into a thousand times, and they don't fix them. They just let them.

( 11:38 ) They put them, they lay them down on the road and they sit there for months. But we don't do that. We don't run things. We run things like we run this. We like clean, we like beautiful, we like safe. And that's what we're getting. So I'll start signing the executive orders. To me, there's a very, very big deal. One of the executive orders has to do with cashless bail. That was when the big crime in this country started. And I can tell you who did it, when, but I don't want to do that because others followed pretty quickly. But that was when it happened. Somebody kills somebody, they go in, "Don't worry about it, no cash. Come back in a couple of months, we'll give you a trial." You never see the person again.

( 12:19 ) And I mean, they kill people and they get out, cashless bail. They thought it was discriminatory to make people put up money because they just killed three people lying on a street, any street all over the country, cashless bail. We're ending it. But we're starting by ending it in DC and that we have the right to do through federalization. Okay, let's go. Could I ask you to say exactly what this is?

Speaker 1 ( 12:44 ):

Of course. So as you've consistently identified, sir, cashless bail policies are a key driver of the disorder we see on city streets all over America. Catch-and-release system allows criminals to keep going back out onto the street and re-offending. What this executive order does, it charges your attorney general with identifying jurisdictions all over the country that have cashless bail policies and then it withholds or revokes federal funds and grants that are flowing to those jurisdictions to ensure that we're only supporting the people who have reasonable common-sense policies around crime.

Donald Trump ( 13:16 ):

So what area does it cover?

Speaker 1 ( 13:18 ):

Potentially anywhere that has a cashless bail policy. So some of the largest cities, some of the most left-wing states in America have adopted-

Donald Trump ( 13:25 ):

Almost all of them, right?

Speaker 1 ( 13:26 ):

Yip. Illinois would be a great example of that, sir.

Donald Trump ( 13:29 ):

Oh, they have a great cashless bail. You don't even have to go to court sometimes. No, Illinois, I love that state, it's a great state, but it's run so badly by Pritzker. They threw him out of the family business and he becomes governor. Now he wants to run for president. I don't think that's going to happen. Okay, we'll sign right here, right.

Speaker 1 ( 13:46 ):

Sir.

Donald Trump ( 13:52 ):

So important. And this isn't Republican Democrat, this is… And by the way, most Democrats agree with this, but this is just we got to bring our country back. Okay, that's a big one.

Speaker 1 ( 14:12 ):

Also on the issue of cashless bail, sir, this is a DC-specific executive order. In addition to the measures that we're taking that are quite similar to what we're doing around the country in DC in particular, the objective is holding as many criminal defendants in federal custody and subjecting them to federal charges as possible. That means that they'll be held pretrial in federal jail as opposed to just being cut back out on the streets due to a cashless bail policy.

Donald Trump ( 14:37 ):

And we have the room. And by the way, the prison they have in DC is horrible. It's horrible. People were subjected to live in that dog trap for so long, so unfairly. I have stories. You'll be hearing about them. That prison is horrible. Okay.

Speaker 1 ( 15:03 ):

This is an executive order that contains a number of additional measures relating to crime and law enforcement in Washington DC. It charges, for example, your Secretary of Defense with establishing specialized units in both the DC National Guard and the National Guard units around the country, specifically trained and equipped to deal with public order issues. It charges all of your various federal law enforcement agencies with hiring additional personnel to allow them to surge personnel to Washington DC to deal with the current emergency here. It does a number of other things in that space and it also asks the Attorney General to look at DC Metropolitan Police general orders that have currently impeded law enforcement efforts in the city, and to potentially look at unwinding those that are stopping the police from doing their job effectively.

Donald Trump ( 15:53 ):

And are we going to ask this to be codified by Congress? All of these things?

Speaker 1 ( 15:57 ):

I think we could potentially, yes, sir.

Donald Trump ( 15:59 ):

I think so. I think we should. I think we'll get it. I think Democrats will vote. Well, it's hard to believe that they might not, but I think Democrats will actually vote for this. There's no auto pen that can do that, right? Look at that, Pam, is that a good signature?

Pam Bondi ( 16:21 ):

There's not. It's a great signature.

Donald Trump ( 16:22 ):

Seriously, is that a good signature? Who can write like that? Nobody. I don't know. That's the other thing, I assume we're looking at the whole auto pen scam because the person that ran it said he spoke to it briefly twice about nothing. That means that all those pardons that he gave to some very bad people, very unpatriotic people, very evil people, it looks to me like those pardons are worthless because number one, you shouldn't use an auto pen, very specifically, but if you do, it has to be a very good reason. And they have to know that the president wanted it. The president didn't want this. The president didn't know he was alive, okay? He never approved any of this stuff. He wasn't for open borders and all the other things. He was never for open borders. I've known Biden a long time. He was never very sharp, but he was never in favor of open borders and all of the other things he did to destroy our country. Let's go.

Speaker 1 ( 17:22 ):

Lastly, sir. This is an executive order on flag burning. It charges your attorney general-

Donald Trump ( 17:26 ):

Will you listen to this? This is very important. Flag burning. All over the country, they're burning flags. All over the world, they burn the American flag. And as you know, through a very sad court, I guess it was a five-to-four decision, they called it freedom of speech. But there's another reason, which is perhaps much more important, it's called death. Because what happens when you burn a flag is the area goes crazy. If you have hundreds of people, they go crazy. You can do other things. You can burn this piece of paper, but when you burn the American flag, it incites riots at levels that we've never seen before. People go crazy. In a way both ways. There are some that are going crazy for doing it. There are others that are angry, angry about them doing it. Do you want to discuss that?

Speaker 1 ( 18:19 ):

Sure. What the executive order does, sir, it charges your Department of Justice with investigating instances of flag burning. And then where there's evidence of criminal activity where prosecution wouldn't fall afoul of the First Amendment and instructs the Department of Justice to prosecute those who are engaged in these instances of flag burning.

Donald Trump ( 18:37 ):

And what the penalty is going to be, if you burn a flag, you get one year in jail. No early exits, no nothing. You get one year in jail. If you burn a flag, you get… And what it does is incite to riot. I hope they used that language, by the way. Did they?

Speaker 1 ( 18:54 ):

Incitement is in there.

Donald Trump ( 18:55 ):

Incite to riot. And you burn a flag, you get one year in jail. You don't get 10 years, you don't get one month. You get one year in jail and it goes on your record. And you'll see flag burning stopping immediately. Just like when I signed the Statute and Monument Act. 10 years in jail, if you heard any of our beautiful monuments, everybody left town, they were gone. Never had a problem after that. It's pretty amazing. We stopped it. But this is something that's, I don't know, in a certain way, it's equally as important. Some people would say it's more important because the people in this country don't want to see our American flag burned and spit on. And by people that are in many cases, paid agitators. They're paid by the radical left to do it.

( 19:42 ) You talk to these people, they don't even know… Half of them don't even know what they're doing. They say, "I don't know. They gave me money to do this." I see the same things that you do. They're bad people that are trying to destroy our nation. That's not working because I think our nation now is the most respected nation anywhere in the world by far. You saw that with

Donald Trump ( 20:00 ):

With the European leaders on Friday, you saw that with NATO where they agreed to go from 2%, no pay, to 5% fully paid up, trillions of dollars paid, where they respect your president to a level that they jokingly call me the president of Europe. They call me the president of Europe, which is an honor, I like Europe and I like those people. They're good people, they're great leaders. And we've never had a case where seven plus, really 28, essentially 35, 38 countries were represented here the other day. 38 European countries were… European and other countries were represented, and it was a great meeting. But your country's respected again. I say it all the time, one year ago, our country was dead, everybody said it. We had a dead country, we were not going to survive. Now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. So it's an honor to be involved and this group has a lot to do with it, right behind me. Does anybody behind me have anything? Pam, would you like to say something?

Pam Bondi ( 21:10 ):

Sure, President, thank you for keeping D.C safe. Just a couple examples of a mother, a single mom whose house was burglarized and the defendant got out on cashless bail, went back the next night and burglarized her house again, that's why this is so important. A man got in a fight with another guy, he had a gun, he was let out. Next night, he got up, went back, and killed him. So that's why it's so important, President, what you're doing. And thank you, and thank you for protecting the American flag. And we'll do that without running a foul of the First Amendment as well. And President, I think Terry Cole… Excuse me. I think Gady Serralta had something he wanted to give you on behalf of all the law enforcement who are out there every single night.

Gady Serralta ( 21:55 ):

Mr. President-

Donald Trump ( 21:55 ):

Yes.

Gady Serralta ( 21:56 ):

Thank you for putting me in charge of this surge as the director of the United States Marshals Service, it's the oldest law enforcement agency. It was created in 1789. So on behalf of all the federal law enforcement agencies that we're working with and those that have yet to join the team, we thought it was only appropriate to present you with an honorary United States Marshals service badge. And this badge comes with this little item right here, which is a handcuff key, Mr. President. Because you continue through your policies and your efforts with your staff to un-handcuff law enforcement officers all over this nation. And I can tell you personally that they thank you for that.

Donald Trump ( 22:51 ):

Thank you. That's beautiful to hear.

Gady Serralta ( 22:52 ):

Continue un-handcuffing law enforcement.

Donald Trump ( 22:55 ):

That's a very great honor. I'll save that and put it someplace up, which is important. Thank you very much, guys, appreciate it. Thank you very much. Really nice, thank you. That's very nice. Thank you. Well, we love those people. They're brave, and they love our country, and they don't want to see… They don't want to see it… Do you know how many people volunteered for this job? And before I ask the VP to say a few words, because he feels very strongly about it, I think it's very important, Pam, that when we do this, that a state require… they come and ask us. I mean, I see Pritzker saying we don't want them, in the meantime his city is being shot to hell. And they do that politically. And they probably do want it. If we didn't go to Los Angeles, you would literally have had to call off the Olympics. It was so bad.

( 23:47 ) And the Sheriff, and the law enforcement people, but the sheriff said, and he came out very strongly, he said, "If we didn't have these people, we were not able to control it." Now four days later, after we had it totally under control, we did that quickly, he changed his tune a little bit. "Well, I think we could have done it," you know? They were dead. If we didn't send in the troops, Los Angeles was dead, the Olympics was gone, the World Cup was gone, everything was gone. We did a great job. And Newsom, you got an… I mean, he's an incompetent governor. But I think people should want us to be there because otherwise all they'll do is complain as we do our job, so we'll have to think about that, okay? We go in, like in Washington, we go in and the people that are here that have been doing… I don't want to say terrible because she happens, you know, she's a nice woman I guess. I don't care about if she's nice, I really don't care. I want her to do… I'd rather have her be horrible, but do the job.

( 24:44 ) But we come into Washington and we have the 11 best days they've had here in two centuries. I mean, they've never seen anything like it. Let's go two decades in over 20 years, they haven't seen anything like what happened. And now they're out there saying, "We don't have crime in Washington." Well, that's true, for 11 days you don't have crime. But before that, everybody was getting hit and mugged and you people could not walk to your office without security. That's how unsafe it was. So I think we should really let them have their city, let their city go to hell, and when they come and beg us to help… The only problem is we want to save it for the… Because the people want us there. The people here, 95% of the people here want us, the real people not the people you find… I don't know where you find these people.

( 25:34 ) You have one person has a broken nose, "Where'd you get it?" "Well, I was mugged." Good. "Do you want to see Trump here with…" "No, I don't want…" The woman has a broken nose, she got mugged, but she's saying she doesn't want any protection. It's all made up fake news, it's just fake news. I don't know where you find these people. Anyway, would you say a couple of words please? And then I'm going to ask JD to say something. You have done an unbelievable job in a short period of time.

Terry Cole ( 26:02 ):

Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 26:02 ):

Highly recommended by you know who, right?

Terry Cole ( 26:03 ):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump ( 26:05 ):

Do you want to say his name?

Terry Cole ( 26:07 ):

Mr. Youngkin, Governor Youngkin. Yes, sir.

Pam Bondi ( 26:09 ):

We stole you from Governor Youngkin.

JD Vance ( 26:09 ):

That's right.

Donald Trump ( 26:10 ):

He called me, Glenn Youngkin called, and he said, "I have somebody who's really fantastic." And based on that recommendation, here you are. You've done a fantastic job. I appreciate it.

Terry Cole ( 26:20 ):

Thank you, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 26:21 ):

Thank you. Go ahead.

Terry Cole ( 26:22 ):

The men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department are back. They enjoy doing their job again. They feel the ability to go out and be law enforcement officers. They feel that they're connected to their communities again. They are making a difference. Thanks to you, Mr. President and our federal task force, you are making D.C once again.

Donald Trump ( 26:43 ):

Good.

Terry Cole ( 26:44 ):

Thank you, sir.

Donald Trump ( 26:44 ):

It's going to get better and better. Well, it can't get much better, there's no crime. I read where crime's down 89%. I said, "Really? Who are the 11%?" Okay. There's no crime. JD, please.

JD Vance ( 26:56 ):

Yes, sir. Well, thanks, Mr. President. Thanks to the incredible team here. I want to echo something the President said, where you say there haven't been murders in a couple of weeks in D.C, and it doesn't sound good. But then you talk to local law enforcement, and I didn't realize this, that this town averaged one murder every other day for the last 20, 30 years. Which means that in two short weeks, the president and the team have saved six or seven lives, people who would've been killed on the streets of D.C, who are now living, breathing, spending time with their families because the president had the willpower to say, no more, we're not going to give the streets of D.C over to vagrants and robbers and murderers.

( 27:36 ) And the last point I want to make, sir, to your point about we want people to welcome us to ask us, because look at Governor Pritzker in Illinois or Governor Newsom in Los Angeles or Governor Moore in Maryland, they're angrier about the fact that the president of the United States is offering to help them get their crime under control than they are about the fact that murderers are running roughshod over their cities and have been for decades. Why are Democrat governors angrier about federal law enforcement helping clean up their streets than they are about the fact that those streets need to be cleaned up to begin with? It shows a real sickness in the head. And I agree with the president of the United States, I think most Democrats rank and file, nobody likes crime. Republicans don't like crime, Democrats don't like crime, Independents don't like crime. Why are democratic governors doing everything in their power to make crime easier to do in their cities? It doesn't make an ounce of sense to me, but Mr. President, I appreciate you being willing to help and I hope these governors take you up on the offer because we should clean up all of America's streets. It's the right of every American to live in safety and comfort in their community.

Donald Trump ( 28:41 ):

And we've got the people to do it. They're signing up like they'd never signed up before. Our military, as you know, during the campaign, nobody was signing up. We were way short, short of their goals, short of their… We were understaffed, nobody wanted to be in the military, nobody wanted to be a policeman, nobody wanted to be a fireman. They didn't want anything to do with the country. We had an incompetent, grossly incompetent president who frankly should not have been there, he should have never been there. The damage he did to this country is incalculable. I mean, just what he has done, so much of our effort are getting murderers and jailbirds and people out of this country who are drug dealers at the highest level.

( 29:26 ) So much of the energy of people that he let in, it was an unforced error, but I don't think they think it's an error, but I don't believe he believed it. It was the radical lunatics that surrounded this guy at this desk who are brilliant people, but with the wrong philosophy. There were some brilliant people, but they're evil people and they're going to be brought down. They have to be brought down because they really hurt our country. But we're getting it back very quickly. And I'll tell you something, our country's now, it's stronger. I think we're more respected than we've been respected in a hundred years. It's a whole different ballgame. JD, can I ask you?

JD Vance ( 30:01 ):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump ( 30:02 ):

You gave a stat on murders here. What were the numbers? You said in a short period of time how many people were murdered?

JD Vance ( 30:08 ):

Local law enforcement told me, sir, that in the past 20 or 30 years, D.C has averaged a murder every other day. That's 200 murders a year, 150, 250. But about every other day, a person has been killed on the streets of Washington D.C. We've been doing this for two weeks, zero people killed. That's real lives saved that the media, and frankly, the entire Democratic party should be saying thank you for saving lives instead of attacking the president of the United States for doing so.

Donald Trump ( 30:36 ):

You know when the person, when a person unfortunately will probably happen at some point when a person's murdered in D.C, it's going to be the biggest story maybe in history. Right?

JD Vance ( 30:47 ):

Yes, sir.

Donald Trump ( 30:48 ):

Somebody was murdered in D.C., Trump is failing. No, we're not failing, we have a safe city. This is maybe the safest city in America right now. That's how good it is. And it would be nice to be appreciated. These people eventually, they're going to have to be appreciated for what they're doing and they're going to have to be appreciated by the officials that are really happy when we go in because they've lost control of their place. Steve Miller, please, say a few words.

Steve Miller ( 31:12 ):

Thank you, sir. So just to, first of all, follow up on what the vice president said, no police officer working in the city can remember a time in their lives when there has been no murders. You can work with the police department for 20 years, 30 years, your whole life. We've checked the records, no one can even find a record of being murder-free for as long as you've been murder-free under President Trump's leadership. Additionally, and the president spoke about this before, but we've uncovered in the process of uncovering a massive scandal in Washington D.C with the doctoring of crime stats. And the Department of Justice under the Attorney General is leading the effort to uncover this. But when we ultimately share the results, it will stun you. The extent to which even though DC had the worst crime in America, honestly measured, it dramatically understated how bad it was. There's even accusations that murders and homicides were reported as accidents instead of murders. I mean, this is how severe the manipulation of the crime data has been in the city. And it will all be uncovered and it'll all be brought to light.

( 32:16 ) I've had a chance to spend some time, as everyone here, with the police officers in the city, members of the public are going up to them and thanking them, just overflowing with radicals because the first time in their lives they can use the parks, they can walk on the streets. You have people who can walk freely at night without having to worry about being robbed, or mugged, or wearing their watches again. They're wearing jewelry again, they're carrying purses again. People had changed their whole lives in this city for fear of being murdered, mugged, and carjacked. It is a literal statement that President Trump has freed 700,000 people in this city who were living under the rule of criminals and thugs.

( 32:55 ) And the last thing I'll say is that under the efforts of Terry to my left and many here, what they found also is that the street criminals here in Washington D.C were doing business directly with the transnational criminal cartels, the foreign terrorist organizations. So not only was the city being run by these criminal thugs, but they were working with some of the most dangerous terrorist organizations on the planet to traffic, weapons and drugs into this city. And what we're uncovering every day is shocking to us, and we look forward to sharing all the results with you. But President Trump, your leadership has uncovered some of the great public safety scandals of our life. And now because of you, people are safe and free for the first time ever in this city.

Donald Trump ( 33:38 ):

Thank you very much, Steve. You know, in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills is great place. I have a house there. I had a house there. I used to stay a lot of time, spend a lot of time there, and great place. Do you know that I have friends, they leave their trunk open for their car because they know they're going to be vandalized, they don't want the trunk ripped off in order for them to steal what's in the back. They leave the doors open, so when they go in to steal the radio or whatever they take that they don't rip off the door. They leave the doors totally open, so the criminals, when they go and open the door, they don't have to break the windows and kill the car in order to steal whatever it is in the car that they're looking for.

( 34:18 ) And that's at a level that nobody's ever seen before, nobody lives like that. I have another friend, he has a garage, and in order to save his garage door, he leaves it open so that people can just walk into his garage, take whatever they want and leave. But all the cars are so many cars, I've been told this by many people, stars, big people, they leave their doors open so the doors aren't destroyed by these criminals. All over Los Angeles, this is taking place. And you know that. I mean, you've heard that. Kristi, could you say a few words for us?

Kristi Noem ( 34:54 ):

Sure. Well, Mr. President, I think one of the most impactful statistics that you use today was of the a thousand arrests that have happened already so far. 439 of them were illegal criminals, which means they never should have been in this country to begin with, but they were in this country invaded over our southern border or our northern border or maritime seas, and then they committed crimes against the American people. So by getting those individuals incarcerated, we've stopped those violent crimes from happening here in the city. And sir, they do exactly like Stephen was talking, they have ties to cartels, they have networks across this country and other cities. So by what you're doing here is going to have a ripple effect in Miami, in Chicago, in other cities because you're grabbing those networks and giving us information and targeting information to go and get more criminals across this country. So thank you for the work that you're doing.

( 35:47 ) We have ICE and CBP, Federal Protective Services, Secret Service, HSI, all of our officers are working with all the other agencies every day here in D.C, and they're so proud to have this kind of partnership, sir. They're so glad that you're letting them do their jobs again. And I don't know if you've heard, sir, but the recruitment campaign for ICE, when we were going to hire 10,000 new officers, we've got over 130,000 people that have applied and raised their hands and said they want to work with ICE. So no matter what the fake news says or what the media says about ICE not having support, they've got incredible support from the American people. People want to join them and help them do what they're doing to make America safe again. So thank you for that opportunity.

Donald Trump ( 36:29 ):

I was going to say that our recruitment drive, so it was dead. During the campaign, they couldn't get… Every story was the Army can't fill up, the Marines, none of them could fill up. They were way behind. We couldn't get anybody to go into the military, couldn't get any police. We have just set records on everybody wants to be in, everybody wants to go in, and we're taking incredible people. I mean the level of… Because of the Supreme Court, it's based on merit. It's all based on merit now, it's not based on anything else. If you need strong people, you have to get strong people. It's all based on merit. But we're setting records in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, the Coast Guard, one of my favorites because I happened to have created it, Space Force. We're very proud of Space Force, it's amazing what it's doing.

( 37:15 ) We are leading in space now. China was killing us, Russia was beating us. China was killing us, we're now killing… We are leading in space by a lot because of Space Force, so we're very proud. But everybody wants to go in. We went from not… And you know how bad that is for the spirit when every story that you were writing a year ago was that nobody wants to go into the military anymore. And if you're in the military, you know how deflating that is. You go home to your family, nobody wants a job that you have. Well, now it's the opposite. Everybody wants to be there and that includes police and fire and everything else. You're doing a good job.

Pete Hegseth ( 37:52 ):

Thank you, sir.

Donald Trump ( 37:52 ):

You're stopping a lot of wars? Just the presence we're stopping… We've stopped seven wars, and really the number is actually 10. We're not including a couple, and we're not including in there what we did with Iran, stopping their nuclear play. They would've had within a month or two, they would've had a nice big nuclear weapon to use. That's not going to happen, that won't happen. Pete, go ahead please.

Pete Hegseth ( 38:17 ):

Yes, sir. Well, Mr. President, thank you very much for your leadership. And the defense department is proud to be a part of this task force. Just like we have been down at the southwest border where crossings are at zero, we've got national defense areas where we're working with border patrol to secure the southern border for the American people, just like Los Angeles, where ICE officers deserve to do their job without being attacked, we're really proud to be a part of defending the nation's capital and ensuring it is safe and beautiful and working with law enforcement. And Mr. President, let me tell you, the morale of the troops getting out there talking to them, they love this mission, they're grateful to be doing it. Whether they're D.C National Guard or other state national guards, and at your direction as well, sir, it's just common sense to make sure they're armed as well. And so they were rolling out, ensuring they're armed, capable of defending themselves and others if need be, supporting law enforcement, and we're proud to be there, sir.

Donald Trump ( 39:05 ):

Well, look at the mission you just accomplished with Iran. 36 hours back and forth, flawless, every bomb hit its target. They went right down those chutes, dark at night, no moon, no nothing, every target, every bomb went right down. They have a chute that goes right down deep into the mountain and they shouldn't have put ventilation in, I can tell you because we used that for our advantage. But what they did… And we had the pilots and even the people that took care of the planes, we had a whole group of people at the White House a couple of weeks ago. And I didn't realize this, but they said… We've been looking at their predecessors, and then, these were the pilots, they said we gave them beautiful medals. And I'll show you the medal. We them a medal just like this. See? Just like that. They were so happy. Gave a lot of them out for that, it was an incredible job. We had 52 tankers, people

Donald Trump ( 40:00 ):

… world realized so that they could refuel. We had many fighter jets, F-22s and F-35s. We had many. It was an amazing operation. It was flawless. Compare that to the operation when they went in with the helicopters crashing and everyone running around the desert and the prisoners being taken, and that was Jimmy Carter. What a horrible thing. This was the exact opposite. This was the exact opposite of what they did in leaving a very, very nice place. The Taliban runs a tough operation in Afghanistan, and I think it was the most embarrassing day in the history of our country. That was Biden. I was leaving and we would've left through strength, tremendous strength. We would've had tremendous… We would've kept Bagram, which is the airbase, one of the largest runways in the world, one of the most powerful. You could land anything on it. Many, many feet thick. You don't build them that way anymore. You can't. But we left it. And now China's occupying that airbase. This was the most incompetent administration in history, the Biden administration. And you're just lucky that they lost because if they won, you wouldn't have a country anymore. And so Pete, you started off by saying the Department of Defense, and somehow it didn't sound good to me. It didn't sound good. Defense. What are we defense? Why are we defense? So it used to be called the Department of War and it had a stronger sound. And as you know, we won World War I. We won World War II. We won everything. Now we have a Department of Defense with defenders. I don't know. If you people want to standing behind me, if you take a little vote, if you want to change it back to what it was when we used to win wars all the time, that's okay with me. All right?

Speaker 2 ( 41:45 ):

That's common sense, sir.

Donald Trump ( 41:46 ):

You go. You let me know if you want to do it. I think Department of War, it just sounded bad. He said, "Sir, on behalf of the Department of Defense," Defense? I don't want to be defense only. We want defense, but we want offense too, if that's okay. So you'll make a decision. But as Department of War, we won everything. We won everything. And I think we're going to have to go back to that. In the meantime, I've stopped all of these wars. I've stopped them. A big one would've been India and Pakistan, but we stopped them all. We stopped three wars. Go to Africa. They like to say, "Oh." Let me tell you, I love Black people and I did great with the vote with the Black people. But they say, "He's a racist. He's a racist." I said, "Really?" For 35 years, a war raged between Rwanda and the Republic of the Congo, and it was a vicious war. 9 million people were killed with machetes, largely, hatchets, machetes. That went on for more than 30 years, but 34, 35 years.

( 42:46 ) And I stopped it. In fact, the presidents are coming in a week or two to sign the… We have the foreign ministers. It's all signed. The war stopped, but I got it stopped and saved a lot of lives. The Congo, that's deep into deepest, darkest Africa. I got that war stopped. Nobody else could have done that. We did a lot of jobs. A lot of wars were stopped that nobody thought would even be possible. And I'll tell you what, the war with India and Pakistan, that was the next level that was going to be a nuclear war. They already shot down seven jets. That was raging. And I said, "You guys want to do trade? We're not doing any trade. We're not doing anything with you if you keep fighting. You got 24 hours to settle it." They said, "Well, there's no more war going."

( 43:35 ) And I used that on numerous occasions, trade. I used trade. I used other… I used whatever you had to use. But we got seven of them stopped. And the one I thought would be easiest, frankly, was going to be Russia and Ukraine. But that turns out to be some big personality conflicts. It's one of those things. But we're going to get that stopped eventually. We're going to get that stopped too. 7,000 soldiers died last week. Think of that, 7,000. I usually say 5,000, but 7,221 soldiers died last week and they're fighting between Ukraine and Russia. And they're not our soldiers, but they're souls. They're living souls. And they leave their homes and they wave to their parents, and their parents are so proud. They leave in a beautiful uniform and a week later they get their head blown off by a drone. New form of military. It's a whole new form of fighting. So I would just like to thank the people that are behind me. Thank you very much. You've done a fantastic job. I appreciate it very much.

( 44:38 ) We're doing a real job, and I'm so proud of D.C. I passed it two days ago and all the garbage is off the streets. It's terrible. I came in a month and a half ago. I'm driving down and I see garbage all over the place. The streets were a pigsty. I won't use the city's names, but you know what I'm talking about. There are plenty of them outside of this country and inside of this country. Baltimore is a horrible, horrible deathbed. It's a deathbed. I know Governor Moore said, "Oh, he wants to take a walk with me." He meant it in a derogatory tone. I said, "No, no. I'm the President of the United States. Clean up your crime and I'll walk with you." But it's tremendous crime. But he was trying to be derogatory. He doesn't have what it takes, but he's trying to be derogatory. And I met him at the Army-Navy game. They said, "Oh, there's Governor Moore. He'd love to see you." He came over to me, he hugged me, he shook my hand. You were there. He said, "Sir, you're the greatest president of my lifetime." I said, "It's really nice that you say that. I'd love you to say it publicly, but I don't think you can do that, so it's okay." But, "No, sir, you're doing a fantastic job. I want to just shake your hand." "Thank you very much, Governor." That was it. And then every time I see him on television, he's knocking the hell out of me. But that's all right. That's called politics. But Governor Moore's got… He's doing a bad job. Newsom's doing a bad job. All of their potential candidates are doing a bad job. I can't imagine Pritzker being even a candidate, but somebody said he is. He can't do the work, can't do the job. He's not temperamentally suited. So I just want to thank you all for being here. Do you have some questions?

Speaker 2 ( 46:20 ):

… the Pentagon and maybe the Secretary of Defense can weigh into, is the Pentagon preparing for military deployment to Chicago? And with what you said there, are you waiting for the government-

Donald Trump ( 46:30 ):

We're ready to go anywhere.

Speaker 2 ( 46:31 ):

Do you want him to call you though?

Donald Trump ( 46:35 ):

We have a full complement of great human beings. We're full. Our military is full. We were way empty one year ago. Now we're full. So we can go anywhere on less than 24 hours notice.

Speaker 2 ( 46:50 ):

Are you waiting for the government-

Donald Trump ( 46:50 ):

And we're doing a lot to interdict to stop drugs from coming in too. We have ships out on sea. We have nobody coming through our border anymore. Nobody. Doesn't that feel good to know that you don't have prisoners coming in and killers, murderers? We had 11,888 murderers led in by the Biden administration. Many of them have been captured, but we still have a couple of thousand that are out there. Some of them, 50% of them killed more than one person, but a lot of them have been captured. What they've done to our country, these people, the circle, this moron that we had behind this desk, what they've done to our country is unthinkable. It's unthinkable. I mean, if you think so much of our time is devoted to correcting a problem that all they had to do is say "close the borders." Remember when he said, "Well, I have no power to close the border. I have to go back and get an act from Congress." I didn't get an act from Congress. I came in, I said, "Close the borders." And Tom Homan, who's not here, has been fantastic. Christie, right?

Christie ( 47:51 ):

He has been. Yes, sir.

Donald Trump ( 47:52 ):

Tom Homan is great. He is a fantastic man and respected by everybody. But I said, "Tom, close the borders. Christie, close the borders." The borders were closed. We didn't go to Congress and get permission. We just closed the borders. And in the last three months, hard to believe this one too, in the last three months, we've had zero people come into our country illegally through the southern border. Nobody would've said That's possible. Yeah, please.

Speaker 3 ( 48:20 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. Today, MS-13 gangbanger and human trafficker Kilmar Abrego Garcia turned himself into ICE in Baltimore. Do you have any comment on this? And why are the Democrats so emotionally attached to this man who beats his wife and is part of a terrorist organization?

Donald Trump ( 48:37 ):

Because they think he's going to be good for votes and I think he's very bad for votes. These people are deranged. He's not good for votes. He beat the hell out of his wife. His wife is afraid to even talk about him. She's been mauled by this animal and through a system of liberal courts, he's doing things. But no, we have that under control and Pam has got that very much under control. Do you want to comment on it, Pam?

Pam ( 49:05 ):

No, no. We've got him under control. He will no longer terrorize our country. He's currently charged with human smuggling, including children. The guy needs to be in prison. He doesn't need to be on the streets like all these liberals want him to be. And as part of this operation here in D.C., we've also taken off MS-13 members. We've taken, I think just last night we got a TDA guy off our streets right here, right around from where we all work, another TDA member, gone because of this project. So we're going to keep America safe from all of these foreign terrorist organizations, including Abrego Garcia.

Donald Trump ( 49:51 ):

Okay. Steve?

Steve ( 49:52 ):

If we could get your reaction, sir. The Israelis bombed a hospital in Gaza, killed 20 people, including five journalists.

Donald Trump ( 49:54 ):

When did this happen?

Steve ( 49:55 ):

This happened overnight today.

Donald Trump ( 49:57 ):

I didn't know that.

Steve ( 49:59 ):

Any reaction to this?

Donald Trump ( 50:00 ):

Well, I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that whole nightmare. I'm the one that got the hostages out. I got them out, all of them. Steve Witkoff has been amazing. He's done a great job. But I'm the one that got them all out through my people and through me. And now we're left with probably a little bit less than 20 because I think one or two are gone. And I said a long time ago, "I'm going to get them out," but when we get down to that final 10 or 20, these people aren't going to release them because they're dead after they release them. So it's a nasty situation. Very nasty. Horrible thing. Yes?

Speaker 4 ( 50:35 ):

Mr. President, could you please elaborate on your post on South Korea? What were you referring to?

Donald Trump ( 50:40 ):

Well, I heard that there were raids on churches over the last few days. Very vicious raids on churches by the new government in South Korea that they even went into our military base and got information that. They probably shouldn't have done that. But I heard bad things. I don't know if it's true or not. I'll be finding out as you know, your new president's coming in just a couple of hours, coming here. I look forward to meeting him. But we won't stand for that. We just won't stand for that.

Speaker 5 ( 51:07 ):

Are you prepared to order National Guard troops though into American cities if those governors don't request the federal deployment?

Donald Trump ( 51:14 ):

I am, but I also think that, look, Chicago, everybody knows how bad it is. Everybody standing there knows. We know. You don't have to be doing any studies. They should be saying, "Please come in." Pritzker should be saying that. I did a favor for Christie Whitmer, a good favor, I think with the fish, the carp, the China carp. Did you ever hear of it? China carp. And it's taken over your Great Lakes. You know about that, right? And she came and she wanted to know if it's possible for us to do something about it. And I said, "Well, I'll do," but I think it's appropriate that the person from Illinois, the governor from Illinois asks also. It's a tremendously expensive project actually. It's invasive. It's horrible what's happened. And we can do it with GSA and various people, but we can do it, we're going to just have to see what happens. We're going to have to see what happens.

Speaker 5 ( 52:20 ):

Do you believe that you have the legal authority-

Donald Trump ( 52:22 ):

But the governor of Michigan came, was very respectful, asked for it. She's done a good job. I did that. I opened the Air Force base, kept it open for F-35s and various planes, F-22s too. I did that for the state of Michigan at her request. And also in our congressmen, we have congressmen that are unbelievably pro-Michigan up there. But some of this stuff, like the lakes, the Great Lakes, this is a big problem that nobody ever talks about. Most of you probably have never heard of. We have a pretty violent fish that comes from China, China carp, Chinese carp, and you see them jumping out. They jump into boats and they jump all over the place. They've got a lot of energy. And there's a way of getting rid of them. It's very expensive. And I didn't get a request from the governor of Illinois is affected maybe more than anybody else. And I think until I get that request from that guy, I'm not going to do anything about it.

( 53:30 ) And I feel the same way about crime. We go in, we will solve Chicago within one week, maybe less, but within one week, we will have no crime in Chicago, just like we have no crime in D.C. But I don't like to go in and do it and then have somebody stand up and say, "What a great job he's doing on crime. And we don't want the military in our state. We don't want the military." Do you understand? Do you understand that?

Speaker 5 ( 53:55 ):

Yeah, these governors will say-

Donald Trump ( 53:56 ):

So I don't know.

Speaker 5 ( 53:56 ):

… there is no emergency respondent.

Donald Trump ( 53:56 ):

So we're going to have a little meeting, I think. I feel like we go in and we do it, like here. To a lesser extent with the mayor. She hasn't been terrible, but she hasn't been exactly saying, "Oh, great." She did say last night, I heard her say that, "Well, we really don't want the military in D. C." Well, that's not very nice, I guess. That's a little bit of a hit. But she's not as bad as some. We saved Los Angeles and all we did is get criticized by this idiot that's running the state into the ground where people are leaving. He should be thanking us and he should be requesting us to be there. And the governor of Illinois should be. Chicago is a disaster. And the governor of Illinois should say, "President, would you do us the honor of cleaning up our city? We need help." They need help. They need help.

( 54:52 ) We may wait. We may or may not. We may just go in and do it, which is probably what we should do. The problem is it's not nice when you go in and do it and somebody else is standing there saying, as we give great results, say, "Well, we don't want the military here." They need help badly. Chicago desperately needs help. Just look at the crime statistics. Look at the statistics that JD said about even I didn't know it was that bad. That's terrible.

( 55:20 ) But all I know is we're being celebrated because we went an entire week, now it's 11 days, we went an entire week without a murder. And I said, "Boy, that sounds terrible." I actually made a speech. I didn't know how to say it, because it's a great number, it's a great thing, but it sounds so bad. I mean, supposing you're from a foreign country which is properly run and they don't have murders and things so much, or in some cases, virtually at all and you have somebody saying, "I'm proud to announce that nobody was murdered in the capital of the United States this week." It sounds terrible, but…

Speaker 6 ( 55:59 ):

Mr. President, you've mentioned Gavin Newsom on crime.

Donald Trump ( 56:03 ):

Gavin New-scum. Yes?

Speaker 6 ( 56:05 ):

Is there a federal mechanism you're hoping to use to fight back against his redistricting constitutional amendment, or is that counter-

Donald Trump ( 56:10 ):

Well, I think I'm going to be filing a lawsuit pretty soon, and I think we're going to be very successful in it. We're going to be filing it through the Department of Justice. That's going to happen. And we're also going to be filing a lawsuit on blue-slipping. Blue slips make it impossible for me, as president, to appoint a judge or a U.S. attorney because they have a gentleman's agreement. It's nothing memorialized. It's a gentleman's agreement that's about 100 years old where if you have a president, like a Republican and if you have a Democrat senator, that senator can stop you from appointing a judge or a U.S. attorney in particular, those two, those are the two, I guess anything. But those are the two that are very important. So we have numerous states where we have unbelievable people.

( 57:01 ) Now, Jay Clayton was just approved in the Southern district, but he was so good. He was a top student, top schools, top everything, went to Sullivan & Cromwell, became the head of Sullivan & Cromwell, came down here with Securities and Exchange Commission, ran it for four years during my term impeccably. Beautiful job. He did an incredible job. And we went to court and the judges, Democrat judges, voted that he could. That's the only way you get by. But generally speaking, you can't do that because you'll have judges from the other party. So Jay Clayton just got approved and he's in, but he didn't get approved by the senators. He got approved by the court system in New York, which was a great thing.

( 57:44 ) And I had a big victory in New York, I might add. I saved myself $500 million with a fake corrupt attorney general, a really corrupt person with a corrupt judge who was disgraceful. And they're being mauled right now by everybody. It's so corrupt. And it kept business out of New York, stuff like that. But the appellate division vacated all of that stuff that you read about. And we're going to do a big number on that whole thing. You can't have a corrupt court system. You can't have that. You have to have borders, and you have to have a free press. Otherwise you don't have a country.

( 58:24 ) But you'll be hearing about the blue-slipping because you don't need two senators, you just need one Democrat senator with a Republican. The only person that I can get approved are Democrats or maybe weak Republicans, but we don't want that. But the only person I will be able to get approved in any of those states where you have a Democrat, I can't get a U.S. attorney, I can only get a Democrat U.S. attorney. And this is based on an old custom. It's not based on the law, and I think it's unconstitutional, and I'll probably be filing a suit on that pretty soon. Yeah, please?

Speaker 7 ( 59:00 ):

During the campaign, you called Kamala Harris a communist, but the Biden-Harris administration, they never called for nationalizing a private company with the federal government like you're proposing with Intel. What do you say to some who say this is a bit hypocritical? And is this the new way of doing industrial policy?

Donald Trump ( 59:18 ):

Yeah, sure it is. I want to try and get as much as I can. If people come in and they need something, as an example, as a real estate person, if I have an agreement and I have any form of a stopgap where I can stop somebody from doing something, I have a covenant in an agreement, and they come to me and they say, "I would like to do something, but you have us restricted," if I do that, then you usually have to pay. Now, in the case of Intel was interesting, but I hope I'm going to have many more cases like it. Intel came in, I met with a gentleman. I had a lot of respect for him. He came in under a little bit of a cloud. I liked

Donald Trump ( 01:00:00 ):

That's his story. I thought he was good. I think he really means to do a good job with Intel. I said, "I'd like to ask whether or not you'd give," because [inaudible 01:00:11], a lot of people said I invested in it. I didn't invest, but I invest my heart in it and my soul because I want the country to be strong. But I said, "I'd like you to give 10% of Intel to the United States of America, not to me, to the United States of America." And I said, "If you have them as a partner, you have the United States as a partner. I think that would be a very good thing for Intel."

( 01:00:33 ) And he thought about it a little bit different, and he said, "I like that idea very much. We have a deal," and I just made 10 billion dollars or 11 billion dollars for the United States of America. And yeah, there will be other cases. If I have that opportunity again, I would do that. And then, you do have stupid people say, "Oh, that's a shame." It's not a shame. It's called business. If somebody's willing to give you 10% of a company and you're not paying for it… And I will tell you, with a company like Intel, as you know, it's had difficulty. I want them to do well. I want them to do well anyway, but I want them to do well in particular then.

Reporters ( 01:01:10 ):

But isn't public ownership of a private company, a new way of doing business in the business of the United States? Isn't that what you were [inaudible 01:01:19]-

Donald Trump ( 01:01:19 ):

So are tariffs. So are tariffs. So as you know, the stock market went up almost 1,000 points on Friday, and it went up, not because of this very, I think terrible… Hello. Who is that back there? Get out of the room. It went up because of something much different. It went up because it was announced, CBO announced, the numbers, and as you know, they gave no credit to tariffs. They said they made a mistake, that the trade deficit will be reduced, because of Trump's tariffs, will be reduced by four trillion dollars. Right? Is that what they said? Right. They said four trillion dollars, and the market went up like a rocket ship because the tariffs are good. Well, tariffs aren't that usual. The seven wars I stopped, four of them were because of the fact that I had tariffs in trade. And I was able to say, "Well, if you do this, if you go fight and you want to kill everybody, that's okay, but I'm going to charge you each 100% tariff when you trade with us."

( 01:02:27 ) You know what? They all gave up. I stopped seven wars. Numerous of them was because of tariffs. So you never knew the word tariff. It didn't exist really essentially in this country until actually in the 1870s, up until 1913, it existed. And we were the richest country. We were richer than, proportionately, than at any time in the history of our country. And then stupidly in 1913, they said, "Let's go to the income tax way of life. Let the people pay instead of foreign countries." No, we're taking in trillions of dollars in tariffs, and we're stopping wars because of tariffs. So that's not so normal either. But you know what? Other countries did it to us, and now we're doing it to other countries.

Reporters ( 01:03:15 ):

[inaudible 01:03:15] rule out boots on the ground in Ukraine. But how would air support as part of a security guarantee be any different? Those US areas-

Donald Trump ( 01:03:24 ):

You really went from one question to the next. [inaudible 01:03:28]. I expected he'd at least challenge you. Now we're talking about boots on the ground.

Reporters ( 01:03:32 ):

But US air assets over the skies of Ukraine as part of a security guarantee, wouldn't those US airmen also be-

Donald Trump ( 01:03:38 ):

Well, you don't know what security guarantee is because we haven't even discussed the specifics of it. And we'll see. Number one, Europe is going to give them significant security guarantees, and they should because they're right there. But we'll be involved from the standpoint of backup. We're going to help them, and I think if we get a deal, and I think we will, but if we get a deal, I don't believe you're going to have much of a problem. But we'll back it up because I want to stop seeing people being killed. When Biden was here, he gave 350 billion dollars, you know this from covering business, 350 billion dollars to Ukraine. I said that Zelenskyy is the greatest salesman I think I've ever met, better than P.T. Barnum because he'd come to the country, he'd walk out with 50 billion dollars every time. He actually came here, once he walked out with 100 billion dollars. We're up to 350 billion. I got a trillion dollars worth of rare earth that we have from the country because I felt badly for our taxpayer. But I did something else at the NATO meeting. They are wealthy countries, but they weren't paying. And we don't pay any money to Ukraine anymore. Do you know that? In fact, it's the opposite. They request through NATO. We deal with NATO. We don't deal really with Ukraine. NATO requests missiles. They want Patriots. They want missiles. We give the missiles to NATO. NATO pays us in full and does what they want. I mean, I think they give them mostly to… They can do other things with them too. Because we're dealing with NATO. We pay no money to Ukraine. We gave 350 billion dollars to Ukraine. If we didn't give that kind of money… And I was the one that gave the Javelins, if you remember. I gave the Javelins. They were very effective.

( 01:05:26 ) They say, "Obama gave sheets, and Trump gave Javelins." They were very effective with those tanks right at the beginning. But you would've never had a war if I were president. You would've never had a war. Just to finish, we spend no money on Ukraine anymore. We were getting fleeced by a president that didn't know what he was doing. To be honest, I don't blame Ukraine, I mean, if they come and ask for 100 billion dollars and they get it, but we were in for 350 billion dollars.

( 01:05:56 ) Now we make money. I don't want to make money on Ukraine. I want the war to end because I want to save all those lives. I want to just say, but just so you understand, we're no longer losing money on that thing. We were losing money hand over fist, and now, we don't lose any money. Now, we sell weapons to NATO because NATO agreed because of me to go to 5%. They had 2% and didn't pay. Now they have 5%, and they're all paid up. So they have trillions of dollars, and they give us that money. But I really want the war to end, and we're going to get it ended.

Reporters ( 01:06:29 ):

Mr. President, [inaudible 01:06:31] the work summit here with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders all met here with you at the White House. You said you wanted to get this done bilateral as soon as possible. Have you spoken to Putin since last Monday, since [inaudible 01:06:42]-

Donald Trump ( 01:06:42 ):

Yeah, I have.

Reporters ( 01:06:43 ):

What is your conversation? Can you share?

Donald Trump ( 01:06:46 ):

Every conversation I have with him is a good conversation, and then unfortunately, a bomb is loaded up into Kiev or someplace. And then I'd get very angry about it. I think we're going to get the war done. It's tough. I thought that would be, of the seven that I settled, I thought that would be the easiest of the group. See, you never know what's going to happen. You know, war, strange things happen in war. The fact that he went to Alaska, our country, I think was a big statement that he wants to get it done.

( 01:07:17 ) That was not easy for him to go to Alaska, for him to come here, but the fact that he showed up on a very successful day, that was a very successful day, for other things because we're also talking about missiles, nuclear. We're talking about a lot of different things. We're talking about limiting nuclear weapons. We'll get China into that. We have the most, Russia has the second most and China has third, but China is way behind. But they'll catch us in five years. We would like to denuclearize. It's too much power, and we talked about that also. That's part of it, but we have to get the war over with.

Reporters ( 01:08:02 ):

[inaudible 01:07:59]. Thank you. On Baltimore, you said that you are going to have to reconsider bridge funding. Is that contingent on Wes Moore cleaning up the streets?

Donald Trump ( 01:08:09 ):

No, we were very generous to him on a bridge. A boat ran into a bridge, and the bridge came down like I've never seen anything. The boat was just, it just shows you the mass of that boat, the power of that boat. People were up on that bridge. Painters, they were painting the bridge, and they were watching it happen. And they thought they were very safe. They all died. They were painting the bridge. Can you imagine? And they watched the boat. The engines were off, and they watched the boat. And the power of that boat, the mass of that boat went right through that steel just like it was nothing. It's amazing. It's called mass. Mass is a big deal, but the mass of that boat, those people all died. But they thought they were totally safe. Two of them were eating their lunch. They were whatever.

( 01:08:52 ) They were watching it. They could have gotten off. Somebody did a very good job. A police officer called in and said, "Close the bridge," and he did it with power. "Get everybody off the bridge. Close that." That guy should get a medal because he stopped the bridge. A lot of people would've died. A lot more people would've died. The ones that died were the workers on the bridge, and they thought there was no danger. It's a big steel bridge, and it came down like toothpicks. It was incredible to watch that, and they died. They all died, but that police officer, again, the police do a great job. The police officer did an amazing job, and I heard the tapes. He would say, "Get everybody off it." Most people wouldn't have said that.

( 01:09:42 ) When you see a thing like that, you assume it's going to tap the bridge, and it's going to be rebuffed. The thing just came down. I've never seen anything like it, so he did a good job. In fact, I think we should get him in for a medal. The man that gave the warning, I listened to him, "Everybody get off." Screaming, "Everybody off." He had the sense to realize that this could be a catastrophe as opposed to a ship that… Because the engines weren't working, it was just floating. It's an amazing thing that a thing floating like that with no power, just knocked it right down like it was nothing. Let's do that. Let's give him a medal. I've been thinking about that.

Reporters ( 01:10:18 ):

Do you plan to investigate Chris Christie?

Donald Trump ( 01:10:21 ):

Say what?

Reporters ( 01:10:23 ):

Do you plan to investigate Chris Christie?

Donald Trump ( 01:10:25 ):

Look, Chris is a slob. Everybody knows it. I know Chris better than anybody in the room. I always felt he was guilty, but what he did is he took the George Washington Bridge, which is very serious, he closed down the George Washington Bridge. And you had medical people, you had ambulances caught up. This thing was closed down, and obviously, he knew about it. But he blamed the young lady that worked for him and another person, and they got into a lot of trouble. She ultimately was, I don't know, exonerated, but she got out of it a little bit. But she went through hell.

( 01:10:58 ) She was a young mother, nice person. I knew her a little bit, and another man went to jail. And Chris got off, and so, when I listened to Chris speak his hate, I say, "Oh, what about the George Washington Bridge? Tell me about the George Washington Bridge." He blamed other people, but he knew all about it. So I don't know if they want to look at it, not for me, if they want to look at it, they can. You could ask Pam. I think we have other things to do, but I always thought he got away with murder.

Reporters ( 01:11:32 ):

Mr. President, are you going to make an endorsement in the Texas Senate race between Ken Paxton and John Cornyn?

Donald Trump ( 01:11:37 ):

Well, I'll make up my mind. I like them both. The worst situation I have is when I have two people that I get along with well. I hate it, and they all want the endorsement. 100% of the people I endorse with, it's a great honor, and I got, as you know, I got the largest vote in the history of Texas by far. Nobody's ever gotten more votes in the last election, I think in all the elections, the three elections, but they like me in Texas. So people are waiting for me, but I'd rather not comment on it right now. I like both guys. They're both friends of mine, and they're both good and very different.

Reporters ( 01:12:16 ):

There's some talk among congressional Republicans about another reconciliation bill. Where do you fall on that, and what would you like to prioritize?

Donald Trump ( 01:12:22 ):

Well, I don't want to do cutting. I want to save all the different things. I'm going to cut things that are unnecessary, but the one thing I said, and I gave my word, we're not going to hurt anybody on Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security. And in fact, we are doing great on Social Security. We found 300,000 illegals on Social Security. We got them out, and things like that make Social Security very, very strong. I am very big into certain things, and one of those three, you could say three of those things, are Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. We're going to protect it, and so, we'll see how everything works out. If we're talking about rescissions on other things, I'm always open to cost-cutting. If we can cost-cut, I like it, but nothing's going to happen to medical. We have something coming up, favorite nations, where I'm going to be reducing drug prices by 1,400, 1,500%, where a pill that sells in Germany for $10 costs $150 here because of the bad… And I was all set to do it, and then we had the COVID come up. And I had to focus on that, because we had the greatest economy in history my first term. I will tell you that we are going to be doing numbers on the cost of drugs in this country.

( 01:13:43 ) I'm not talking about a 20% decrease, which would be great. I'm talking about 1,000% decrease. We're talking about, where a product would sell for $80 in Germany and $1,300 here, and we're not going to do that. We were subsidizing the entire world, and we're not doing it anymore. I informed the drug companies. I informed the world, and if the world wants to, if countries in the world don't want to go along, then I'm going to put tariffs on those countries. And we'll make more money, but they have to go along with it. So this is moving along rapidly. Dr. Oz is in charge, Bobby's group, and they're doing very well. And we're getting great cooperation from the drug… because the drug companies know it's unfair.

( 01:14:26 ) For years, they'd say, "Well, we had to do research, and we had to do… " I said, "I don't care. You had to do research for these other countries also." They are ready to go, and I'm ready to go. And if I pull that off, there's no way a Republican will lose an election. There's no way. All right. One more question. Steve? Watch this guy. He's the nicest guy I know, and he asked the most vicious questions.

Reporters ( 01:14:53 ):

Why do you think President Putin is so reluctant to meet with President Zelenskyy?

Donald Trump ( 01:14:57 ):

Because he doesn't like him. He doesn't like him. They don't like… I have people I don't like. I don't like to meet with them. Sometimes I do like to meet with people that I don't like.

Reporters ( 01:15:07 ):

So how do you [inaudible 01:15:08]?

Donald Trump ( 01:15:08 ):

They don't like… No, they don't like each other, really. And if we had a real president instead of a guy that got in there with a fraudulent election, if we had a real president, that war would've never happened. Putin actually said, he said, "If Trump were president, it wouldn't have happened." It happened for a lot of reasons. It happened because of Afghanistan. When he saw how incompetent Milley was and all these guys were, I think he said, "Wow, this might be… " because it was the apple of his eyes. It would've never happened if I were president.

Reporters ( 01:15:38 ):

Mr. President, you have built a relationship with Russian leaders and also North Korean leaders. As they are getting closer, how does that affect your diplomatic approach?

Donald Trump ( 01:15:47 ):

Well, I have very good relationships with Kim Jong Un, North Korea. I mean, a lot of people would say, "Oh, that's terrible." No, it's good. In fact, someday I'll see him. I look forward to seeing him. He was very good with me. We had two meetings. We had two summits. We got along great. I know him better than you do. I know him better than anybody almost, other than his sister. His sister knows him pretty well. Now I know him well, and I got along with him. I'm not supposed to say I really like him a lot because if I do that, I get killed in the fake news media. But I got along with him very well, and we had no problem. If at the time, Hillary Clinton won the election, you would've had a nuclear war. You would've had a nuclear war. We're not going to have a nuclear war. Once that happens, it's over. We're not going to have a nuclear war. No, but Kim Jong Un, we'll meet at some point. I look forward to it actually. But do you notice that since I came into office, you haven't had a problem with him. There hasn't been. He tests lots of rockets. He does have great capability. I will say that, but I think a lot of good things, a lot of good things are happening for our country. A lot of really good things, and the thing we're here today to talk about is crime.

( 01:16:57 ) And specifically in DC, I am so proud of what these people, every one of them, what they've done in DC because to literally stop crime on a button, I'd walk down that street right now. Friends of mine are going out to dinner now. They haven't gone out to dinner in four years. They were afraid. They were petrified. Half the restaurants closed because nobody could go because they're afraid to go outside. Now those restaurants are open, and new restaurants are opening up. It's like a boom town. It's a great thing to see, and I'm very proud of the people behind me. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
