Byron Donalds ( 00:00:12 ):

Oh yeah. Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Richard, it's loud in here. These people are excited. Laurie Buckhout, you're going to be our next member of Congress and I had no idea... I had no idea how rowdy they are in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Barack Obama said that we were bitter clingers. Hillary Clinton said we were deplorables. We don't really know what Kamala Harris says. She's still a middle-class child. I don't know. Don't know what she says. I have no idea what Kamala is talking about. Yeah, I know. We don't either. I agree with you. And then Joe Biden says that we're garbage. Well, we have news for the Democrat elites. We're none of those things. We are Americans. And in in six days North Carolina's going red and Donald Trump's going to be the 47th President of the United States My job today is simple. This is for all the press here. This is for the people of North Carolina. This is for every American and every part of our country. They have broken our nation. They have failed in leadership. And there is one man who will fix it, and his name is Donald J. Trump. North Carolina, the job is now in your hands. Get out to the polls and make sure you vote. Make sure that your friends... And you know who they are. Oh my gosh, it's the ladies of North Carolina. How are you and your husband? I see you there, sir. I see you. Make sure you get your friends out to the polls. You know the ones we're talking about. They're busy. They've got kids, they're working hard. Life is coming at them every step of the way, but they have a job to do as Americans like all of us in this arena today. And that job is to go to the polls, make sure your voice is heard, and make sure that JD Vance is the next vice president and Donald Trump is the 47th president.

( 00:03:41 ):

I don't want to talk about Kamala. I don't want to talk about her. I'm done with her. This is about us. This is about America. We need a leader whose foreign policy is us getting out of wars not into one. We need a leader who's going to secure the southern border and tell illegal immigrants it is time for them to go home. We need a leader who's going to build a strong economy again. So whether you're a senior on fixed income or a young person trying to get ahead and buy a home, you can have an economy that will work for you. And this is my own personal... And frankly, I know I'm in North Carolina, so I know this is yours too. We need a leader who's going to protect children and end this radical transgender ideology. We're going to protect kids in America and we're going to get men out of women's sports in America. So Rocky Mount, we got six days to go. Are you with us? You got six days in North Carolina. Are you turning out to vote? We got six days in North Carolina for it to go red. And we got six days for North Carolina to join the other states and make Donald Trump the 47th president. God bless you, North Carolina. God bless, America.

Speaker 1 ( 00:06:24 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage House Majority Whip, Congressman Tom Emmer.

Tom Emmer ( 00:06:32 ):

How about that? Byron Donalds. It's so great to be in North Carolina. Are you ready to win on Tuesday? So they told you, I'm Tom Emmer. I'm the House Majority Whip. I come from the great state of Minnesota. Did anyone see that debate where JD Vance wiped the floor with Tim Walz? Tim Walz has been lying in plain sight for 20 years in my state. We were very happy. Now, interesting, vice presidential debates don't necessarily determine the presidential election, but ever since JD destroyed Tim Walz, the Harris campaign has been on the descent while the Trump campaign is going up.

( 00:07:57 ):

And that's because... Think about this for a second. Why was Tim Walz picked? Well, he's a really glib talker. He's got jazz hands. He can do all the talking. He was supposed to be Kamala's emotional support animal. But guess what? JD Vance ended that. Tim Walz has not been the same since and ever since Kamala keeps making mistakes. You know how? She opens her mouth. All right, guess what? We're going to have a big day next Tuesday. We're going to have a chance to save this country. But as Byron just told you, it doesn't happen just because we say it's going to happen. You have six days left. We have six days left. It is time to leave it all out on the field. You got to knock those last doors. You got to make those last phone calls. You got to tell your family, your neighbors, your friends, your co-workers, it's time to stand up and speak up by exercising your right to vote because we are going to send Donald J. Trump back to the White House.

( 00:09:07 ):

All right, there's your mission. Are you ready? Win the Senate, expand the majority of the house, and reelect Donald J. Trump. And let's get to saving this country. Thank you, North Carolina.

Donald Trump ( 00:18:34 ):

When I first came into office, I cut taxes more than any other president. We have created 7 million new jobs and it led to a growth like we've never seen before. We developed the greatest economy in history by far. When I left office, it changed. Inflation destroyed the lives of so many people. Interest rates went from 2% to 10%. Millions of illegal immigrants, traffickers, and drugs coming into our country. Our country has gone to hell. So I made a decision to run. We're going to make America great again, greater than ever before. I will fight for you with every breath, and I will never let you down.

Speaker 2 ( 00:19:31 ):

President Trump is literally putting his life on the line and he's willing to risk it all because he loves this country.

Speaker 3 ( 00:19:39 ):

He is strong, he is fearless, and he is what this country needs right now.

Speaker 4 ( 00:19:46 ):

Our cities will be safe, our streets will be clean, and our border will be secure.

Speaker 5 ( 00:19:53 ):

We can't allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people, our freedom, and our future.

Speaker 6 ( 00:20:01 ):

The left told me to hate Trump. When you cut through the lies, you realize the truth. American families were better when Donald Trump was president. We were safer, wealthier, and stronger.

Speaker 7 ( 00:20:13 ):

So if you love this country, if you want to stand up and fight for the future of our nation, you must re-elect Donald J. Trump.

Speaker 1 ( 00:20:33 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.

Donald Trump ( 00:23:23 ):

Well, thank you very much, North Carolina. You are a special group of people. In fact, my beautiful little grandchild, the most beautiful little girl you've ever seen is named Carolina. You know that? I'm thrilled to be back in this incredible state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. But I'd like to ask you one very simple, easy to answer question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I am here today with a message of hope for all Americans with your vote in this election. Oh, it's coming up so nice. We're down to six days, maybe sort of five. Maybe five, the way you count it. Six days, can you imagine? I will end inflation. I will stop the massive invasion of criminals into our country and I will bring back a thing called the American Dream. Isn't that nice? Because we haven't had that. We haven't had that in a long time. Our country will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before.

( 00:24:47 ):

And this election is the choice between whether we'll have four more years, think of this, four more years of gross incompetence, the most corrupt, horrible people. These are horrible people. Oops, we should get along with everybody. They're horrible people. Some people you just can't get along with. You can't. But whether we're going to have four years of incompetence and failure, or whether we'll begin the four greatest years of the history of our country, that's what's going to happen. And I'm asking you to be excited about the future again. You have to be excited about... We have a great potential. If we have to go another two days beyond that term, we're not going to have a great... We have to get this done now because we're not going to have a second chance. There'll never be a second chance. It's too far gone.

( 00:25:44 ):

We are a failing nation. We are a nation in decline. But don't worry, we will not be a nation in decline for too much longer, I'll tell you. We'll be a nation of incline as opposed to decline. But I'm asking you to dream big again. You're going to have to dream big again. It's going to be hard for you to do that because you've gone through a long period. But we had some great four years. This will be America's new golden age. This will be better than what we had even four years ago. Remember, we were energy independent. We had everything. Every problem facing us can be solved. But now the fate of our nation is in your hands. And this is a very important state. Number one, I love the state. Number two, we've always won. I won the primaries and I won the elections, and I didn't have to worry about it.

[NEW_PARAGRAPH]So if you think 2016, we did great. 2020, we did much better actually. They say, "Oh, these are conspiracy theorists." We only got about, what, 12 million more votes. But this is the best of all. This is more enthusiasm than there was for even 2016 or 2020. This is the best. Nobody's ever seen it. I just saw a General Kellogg wherever he may be backstage, where is he? Oh, there. Look at that general. He's a real general, not like Milley. Not like Milley, not like Kelly Lowe. He's a low IQ guy, but he is a... This is a real general, he's great. But he said backstage, "This reminds me, sir, of 2016." I said, "Thank you very much." That's a good reminder, isn't it? He's a great guy. This Tuesday you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala that you've had enough, that you're not going to take it anymore.

( 00:27:51 ):

Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here, Kamala. The hell out of here. The worst vice president, the worst border czar. She's the worst border czar in the history of the world. There's never been a border in the history of the world that allowed criminals to pour through. 21 million people, think of it. Well, we're running a campaign of solutions to save America, an America which they have virtually destroyed during their almost four-year period of rule. Kamala Harris, a low IQ individual, is running a campaign of hate, anger, and retribution. See, I'm very nice to them. They are not nice to me. She spends all of her time complaining about everything, but there's nothing about it. She's going to do this, she's going to do that, going to... Why the hell didn't she do it, right?

Donald Trump ( 00:29:00 ):

So now she's talking about what she's going to do on the border. "Well, I'm going to do this and that, and this and that." All they had to do was leave the border alone. We had the safest border in the history of our country. In fact, to prove it, put up my chart, that favorite chart. I love that chart. I love that chart. That was the day I left office. We had the lowest number ever. The day I left office was where the red arrow is on the bottom. And then it became like an Elon Musk rocket ship, right? Look at that. Look what happens to it. Right after that, it went to hell. They let it go to hell. We had Remain in Mexico. You couldn't come into our country. You had to remain... Do you think that was easy to get from Mexico? I had to be very threatening. I always said, "You're not going to do it?" "No, sir, we're not. Why would we do that?" I said, "Because if you don't do it, I'm going to put a 100% tariff on your cars coming in." "Sir..." Took me about one minute. They went from, "We will absolutely not do that, sir. Why would we do a thing like that, Remain in Mexico? They have to remain in your..." I said, "No, no." I tell you why. You know why? They went from that to saying, "Sir, we would be delighted to do whatever you'd like. Whatever you..." And I said, "We're going to put 100% tariff on your cars if you don't do it." So they said, "We'd love to have our people have... We would love to have MS-13 gang members, criminals, people from mental institutions stay in our country. It would be our great honor, sir." It was really amazing. It took less than a minute.

( 00:30:51 ):

But... Or what she's going to do about inflation. "I'm going to do things about..." She caused the inflation by screwing up my energy policies. She caused the inflation. And spending way too much money on the green new scam. She caused it. But why didn't she do something about it, right? Or what she's going to do to get the economy going. "We're going to do this and that." By the way, her plans are the plans of a simpleton. They're not going to work. We'll be in a depression like 1929. " What we're going to do to get the economy..." But why didn't she do it? Why didn't she do all these things? She's saying, "We're going to do this." She's trying to disassociate herself from sleepy Joe Biden.

Speaker 8 ( 00:31:41 ):

She's an idiot.

Donald Trump ( 00:31:42 ):

I like this audience. I didn't say it. [inaudible 00:31:52] who just said that? He can handle himself. They scream, "She's an idiot." But I didn't say it. I didn't say it. In fact, I'd like to admonish you, sir, you should not say that. Please. This way the press can't get me. They say, "Well, I know he... It's really good. Well, no, I don't. I don't accept that, sir. I would never accept a thing like that. No, but she is... He can handle himself, that guy too. She and Crooked Joe head up the worst administration in the history of our country. They've made Jimmy Carter look like a truly great president. In all fairness to Jimmy, he didn't let 21 million people, many of them criminals and those that are mentally ill, pour into our country. He didn't let the... Jimmy Carter didn't allow that to happen. Last night, Kamala made a speech, not much of one, with a paid for audience, and all she talked about was Donald Trump.

Kamala Harris ( 00:33:01 ):

Good evening, everyone. Tonight I will speak about Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump. Trump.

Donald Trump ( 00:33:39 ):

Do you believe it? Because she and Joe have no achievements, only failure and gloom. See, that was so perfect. It worked out perfectly. I said, how am I going to... Normally you'd stop and you'd say, please take a look at the video. But I have some very talented people. I say, when I say Donald Trump, you just let that go. They did a good job. And then I finished the sentence. Because they have no achievements, because they have no... Because they're a disaster. She suffers from a very serious disease known as Trump Derangement Syndrome, Trump Derangement Syndrome. TDS, sometimes referred to as TDS. It's quite serious.

( 00:34:22 ):

It's inflicted havoc on some lives. But many Democrats suffer from that disease, and it's only because of one reason, because we're winning. This week, Kamala has been comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. And now speaking on a call for her campaign last night, Joe Biden finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters. He called them garbage. And they mean it. Even though without question, my supporters are far higher quality than Crooked Joe or Lying Kamala. My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple. You can't lead America if you don't love Americans. You just can't. And you can't be president if you hate the American people, and there's a lot of hatred there.

( 00:35:44 ):

Kamala Harris is not fit to be President of the United States. She doesn't have the intellect, the stamina, or that special quality that real leaders must have to lead. We know what that is. It's a special quality. Joe Biden's comments were the direct result of Kamala's and Tim Walz. You know who that is. His decision to portray everyone who isn't voting for them as evil or subhuman. You're not subhuman. I'm looking at you. You are not subhuman. And we know it's what they believe because look how they've treated you. They've treated you like garbage, frankly, they've treated you like garbage. You know what the truth is? They've treated our whole country like garbage, whether they meant to or not, because they're grossly incompetent people, and they've destroyed our country. Our country is suffering right now, like it's never suffered, with inflation and with the infliction... Think of it.

( 00:36:49 ):

They've allowed millions and millions of people to come into our country that are criminals, that are the highest level criminals. 13,099 border patrol, which endorsed me by the way, very strongly. And it wasn't like I had any competition. 13,099 murderers, many of them murdered more than one person. These are the numbers from border patrol. During their term 13,099 murderers were led into our country. You have drug lords, you have terrorists, you have people from mental institutions. They're all led into our country. And I actually feel it's number two or number three on the list of things. Number one is the economy, number two is inflation, number three is what they've done to our border, what they've done to our country. They call it immigration. It's not immigration. It's horrible. It's horrible. And I think that it's frankly should be number one on the list. I think inflation is terrible. What they've done with inflation is gross incompetence, but when they allow 21 million people, and it's probably much more. That doesn't even include the got aways. You know got aways? These are people that just run across the border.

( 00:38:16 ):

What they've done to our country, there's never going to be an excuse for what they've done to this country. For the past nine years Kamala and her party have called us racists, bigots, fascists, deplorables, irredeemables, Nazis, and they've called me Hitler, called me Hitler many years ago. Many years ago I had a father who was a great guy, he was a strong guy, a legitimate guy, strong, but he always used to tell me, never use the word Nazi and never use the word Hitler. Now we're called Nazis and I'm called Hitler. I'm not Hitler. Boy, my father, he's looking down. Well, my mother, I know she's looking down. My father is a little questionable because he was a little rough.

( 00:39:12 ):

I think he's looking down. Because he was a good guy, he was a strong guy, but he was a good guy, but he's looking down. He says, "Can you imagine that's what they're calling my son? I told him for years, literally, never use the term Nazi or Hitler." Now they're using it on us. It's unbelievable. They've bullied you. They've demeaned us. They've demonized us and censored us and deplatformed us, and weaponized the power of our own government against us. They've gone after their political opponent. Me. It's unbelievable. Did you see? "Donald Trump wants to put us in jail. Donald Trump is going to go after some of the scum that you see back there, that you see back there." They're so dishonest.

[NEW_PARAGRAPH]" Donald Trump is doing horrible things. He wants to put us in prison." That's what they'd been trying to do to me for three years. They got the story mixed up. And we won the big case in Florida already. We're doing very well. We're doing very well. Remember. "Oh, we got him in Florida." That was the documents case, and I had the Presidential Records Act and lots of other things, but Joe Biden had the same case except times 10 because he took it out when he wasn't president. He did a lot of things. And they found him guilty, but they let him go because he was mentally incompetent, but they said he could be president. So they said, "He can't stand trial. He's mentally incompetent. He's got no memory" and he's just got it. He just doesn't have what it takes. Okay, but think of this. Here's the ruling.

( 00:40:59 ):

He can't stand trial because he's mentally incompetent, but he can be the President of the United States. Figure that one out. Mr. Congressman, figure that one out, Hudson. Can you imagine? They have taken your money, they've thrown open your borders to criminals and terrorists. They've flooded your towns with deadly drugs and death. They've given your jobs to illegal migrants and sent our blood and treasure to fight really stupid foreign wars, countries that you've never heard of, countries that you and your children have never even heard of. This Tuesday is your chance to stand up and declare that you are not going to take it anymore. You're not going to take it. Six days from now we can turn the page forever on this failed and corrupt administration. They are corrupt, they have failed, and they are corrupt. They're the worst administration. Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of our country.

( 00:42:12 ):

And his partner, now she's trying to convince everybody, "Oh, well, I really had nothing to do with anything." I'm sure he loves hearing that. She is the worst vice president in the history of our country. By the way, if you go back a few months, everybody was saying she's the worst vice president, she's incompetent, she's a dope, she's everything you can imagine. All of a sudden they decided they better get politically correct, okay? And they chose her over 12 people that are far more competent. We can declare once and for all that we are done with their hatred. We are done with their hysteria. We are done with their hoaxing, lying, cheating, scheming, plundering, and stealing. And we're not going to let them divide and destroy America any longer. And that goes for Barack Hussein Obama too.

( 00:43:13 ):

He's a divider. He's a divider. And Michelle, oh, she said bad things about me. Oh. Michelle got out there the other day. Oh. I've been very nice to her. I guess that means I don't have to be nice anymore. Oh, this is... I'm looking forward to this. Now Obama was a great divider. He was a great, great divider. What we have built is the biggest, broadest, most incredible coalition, and the greatest political movement in American history. I think in any history, if you want to know that [inaudible 00:43:52] It's made up of the hard working men and women who make this country run, who make this country great. We've brought together veterans and union members, soldiers and steelworkers, farmers and autoworkers, and patriotic moms and dads of every race, religion, color, and creed. Right?

( 00:44:16 ):

We're welcoming historic numbers of African Americans and Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans and Arab Americans. And we're uniting Christians and Jews and Catholics and Evangelicals and Muslims and Mormons, and everyone who simply wants one thing. They want one thing, to make America great again. That's all they want. Our campaign has been endorsed by the 400,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police. And I don't believe there's a police organization in America that hasn't endorsed us, and I don't believe there's even a single policeman or policewoman, a cop. That's another thing my father always used to say, "Never call them cops. That's disrespectful." I don't know. I think, look, I'm going with my father, so we're going to say policeman or policewoman. "Never call them cops. That's disrespectful, son." I don't know. Makes sense. If my father said it, I'd do it.

( 00:45:41 ):

But think of that, I don't think a single policeman or policewoman has endorsed her. She was a leader of Defund the Police. That's hard to get an endorsement. "Yes, I was in charge of defunding the police for 10 years. I'd love to have your endorsement." But then we had the border patrol agents who were so incredible. Four years, they haven't called her. She hasn't called... Think of this, four years... I said, "Has she ever called? Has Biden ever called, Sleepy Joe?" "No." I said, "You don't mean no, you mean maybe they haven't called you, but have they called you?" We had the top 10 leaders up. They gave me the best endorsement you've ever heard. And the worst statement about her. They said, she's grossly incompetent. And then she's supposed to be running. I don't believe... They say it's a close race. I can't believe it's a close race.

( 00:46:36 ):

I just can't believe it. But I said, "Did she ever call you?" "No, sir. Never once." I said, "You mean in almost four years?" "No, she never called, sir. Never once. Nobody. She never called anybody." She was in charge of the border, where they called her Border Czar. She doesn't want that name anymore because it was so bad. She did such a bad job. But she was in charge of the border, think of this, and she never called border patrol one time in four years. By the rank-and-file membership of the Teamsters who endorsed us. I will tell you, the Teamsters, that was, we got 62% or something. And I got the endorsement. Oh, what a beautiful endorsement. I love brilliant people. We don't have too many of them. We have to protect our brilliant people. We only have... There aren't too many of them.

( 00:47:27 ):

There aren't too many of them, period. But a certain guy that took a rocket that's 22 stories tall and came back down, and those thrusters went off. And I said, "Oh, no, it's going to crash into the gantry. It's going to crash. It's going to be terrible." But it didn't, it came down and it was just about ready, then the fire blew out of the bottom on the left side and it moved it over, and then it came here and it came down, and those two big arms grabbed it like you grab your baby, like you grab your baby, right? Elon Musk gave us a great endorsement. And do you know?... Oh, I just spotted somebody. I didn't know he was going to be there. Is that who I think it is? My eyes are what they... Stand up, please, would you?

( 00:48:23 ):

Yes. How are you? Huh? And look at these two. Look at these. These two ladies have been with us, and this guy has been by their side right from the beginning. In fact, they take the place oftentimes of some of our front row Joes, so very successful people. Thank you very much appreciate. But Elon gave us an endorsement that was beautiful. He said, "It's the most important election we've ever had. If Trump doesn't win..." And he doesn't... He wants to just... He's a very straight shooter. "If Trump doesn't win," he said, "we don't have a country anymore. We're not going to have a country." And it was amazing, actually. And you know where he is right now? He's campaigning for me in Pennsylvania. Can you imagine? He told me something very interesting. He said, "For an election to be really on the up and up, you have to use paper ballots." He said that to me.

( 00:49:33 ):

Now, here's a guy who I would say is the all time genius at computers. He was telling me that when you see those rockets firing, he said, "The computers are more important than the engines." I understand. He knows more about computers than anybody I've ever met, and I know some pretty smart people. I had an uncle that was at MIT, a professor for 41 years, the longest-serving professor ever. I have that... It's something in my blood about that. Elon knows more about computers than anybody there is. Every time you see those rocket ships land in the ocean on a raft with a circle, boom, it's unbelievable, right? And he said, "For purposes of voting," because there's never a computer that's not easily cracked, easily if you're a genius, more difficult if you're less than a genius. But he said the best way to have an election is very simple, paper ballots, voter ID, proof of citizenship, same-day voting. And he said, same-day voting.

[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And there's a guy who's the number one computer guy. You would think... It's interesting, paper ballots would cost 8% of what you have... Now, I'm hearing all sorts of stories. We're not going to have the result by Tuesday night. We spent all this money on computers. If you go back to paper ballots, and it's watermarked, paper is now very sophisticated, believe it or not. It's all watermarked. You can't play around with it. They can check it immediately. It's all identified. But paper ballots, so think of it, 8%, it would cost 8% of what the machines cost. Now, they hate when I talk about this, but I just want to see one thing. I don't care whether it's machines or whatever's going to be the best, but if paper's the best... Paper... One day voting. You know why? Because we don't want the air conditioning to be fixed.

[NEW_PARAGRAPH]"Oh, excuse me. You'll have to move those ballots in that room. We're going to fix the air conditioning." "Oh, where are we going to move them?" "Well, let's move them out of the place for a little while. We'll move them back next week." "Oh, where are they? There were 14 boxes, now there's six. What happened to the rest of them?" No. One day voting. You have one day voting. We used to have one day voting. By the way, France went back to paper. France had 39 million people. They had voter ID. They had proof of citizenship. That's all. They didn't have mail-in. Mail-in. How about California? They mail out about 38 million ballots. 38... It's like you're throwing all off a building, 38 million. And then they get sent back somewhere, nobody knows where. And then they always announce that the Republicans are about five million short without fail. Because I believe that if we had an honest election...

( 00:52:32 ):

If God came down from on high and God said, "I will be, I will be the voting tabulator for the day," I believe I would win California because I do great, I do great with the Hispanics. I believe I'd win. We need God as our vote counter just one day every four years. We won't even go after the two. We won't even talk about for the congresspeople that we have sitting all over the place. Just for the presidential elections. If we had God, oh boy, would it be a lot easier and a lot better. The other thing we need is we need an honest and respected press. We don't have that. So I want to thank Elon Musk, and I just thought I'd give you his words of wisdom, but that's what he said. He said, "Paper ballots are the way to go, and it's the only way to go." And you're talking about a fraction of the cost. And you would have the election determined, solidly determined by nine o'clock or 10... Whatever time you want. They put them in boxes. They seal the boxes, they hand the boxes.

( 00:53:50 ):

Every box has so many. You would have an accurate count by nine o'clock, 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock, whichever hour you chose. And they had that in France. It ended at 10 o'clock. The vote was broadcast. Nobody said, "Oh, I won or I did..." Everyone went home. They had a winner and they had a loser. Everybody went home. It's a shame. And we're talking about for a fraction. If you said it costs 10 times more, you should do it, but it costs only about 8% of what they spend for machines that send these results to who knows, who knows where. Very, very unfortunate, very unfortunate. We got, last time we got more votes than any sitting president in the history of our country. But we lost, they say. We're also endorsed by somebody that loves healthy people. He wants to make our country so healthy, and he's a great guy.

( 00:54:57 ):

Now, he wants to make our cut. He also has a big thing on the environment, and I'll tell you what I say, that's okay, but you can't touch our liquid gold, Robert. Bobby Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. RFK Jr. and he's going to work... And he does, he's very strong on the pesticides and all of the different things. And you know what? We don't have a very healthy country. When you look at our country compared to other countries, we are not a healthy country. And he says, we're going to make it a healthy country. I say, "Good, Bobby, but do me one favor, don't touch the oil and gas. Let me handle that. I'll handle the oil and gas." We're not going to let him get involved. We're not going to let him get involved in the oil and gas.

( 00:55:42 ):

Well listen, now, we'll watch that. We are going to be very careful with our liquid gold. That's one of the biggest assets we have as a country. We have more liquid gold than anybody, including Saudi Arabia, Russia. Tulsi Gabbard came in, highly respected, a woman of great common sense. And they just gave me the name, because I've had great respect, but I didn't know exactly why they had him on. Buzz Aldrin, very respected, the great astronaut, and highly respected. But I thought it was an unusual, because we have a lot of people that endorse us, and do you notice the Washington Post to the Los Angeles Times and all these papers? They're not endorsing anybody. You know what they're really saying? Because they only endorse Democrats. They're saying this Democrat is no good.

( 00:56:32 ):

They're no good. And they think I'm doing a great job. They just don't want to say it. Washington... And USA today, congratulations. I just heard USA today has not endorsed. They said, we're not going to endorse. That means that they think she's no good. But Buzz Aldrin is very interesting because, great astronaut, but he's not the youngest person in this room, but he's very sound man and great, looks fantastic. What he did is he said, "I've never endorsed anybody in my life before," like General Kellogg. "I've never endorsed...." Of course, he started endorsing me approximately about a minute after I announced I was running. But that's because he's a smart general. Right? One minute. Was it one minute or was it 30 seconds?

( 00:57:22 ):

But Buzz Aldrin for the first time in his life, he said, "This is the first time I've ever made an endorsement. Never made an endorsement. I'm endorsing Donald J. Trump." Isn't that nice? So thank you, Buzz Aldrin. And I like him too. I've always admired him. Kamala and Joe call them, all of those people that I just named and all of the people here, and I think probably more than 200 million people in this country. We really don't know how many we have because those borders have been opened so badly. You don't know. Other countries can tell you approximately what they have. I don't think this country

Donald Trump ( 00:58:00 ):

Country does. But let's say you had 350 million people. If she won, you'd have 600 million people in about three years. You'd have open borders, every criminal from all over the world. Well, we're going to have that pretty soon anyway, but we're going to deport them out of here fast. But let's say 225 million people. She's essentially, and he's calling them garbage, they're a team, by the way. Oh, she hated that last night when she heard that. Although honestly, I don't think she's smart enough to know what it really means. What that meant, that makes deplorable look like baby stuff, right? Deplorable with her... Remember Hillary? She said, "Deplorable and irredeemable." And I said, "Oh, what a terrible term to use the word irredeemable." Somehow irredeemable, I think it's worse, right?

( 00:58:56 ):

But you know what's worse than anything? Garbage. We're garbage. We're garbage. And I call you the heart and soul of America. You're the people that built America. And together on November 5th, we're going to bring our country back to levels of greatness never seen before. And I'll tell you, look, North Carolina, it has been special. When you just win a place? I love you. I love Alabama. In Alabama, I win by 48 points. Even you haven't caught us on that. Tennessee, we have so many great states that really love us. You know the nice thing is, when you have a place that you can just rely on, where you can really rely... I love you too. Look at her. She's so beautiful. She's all excited. I love it. I do.

( 01:00:00 ):

And there's Mr. Wall. See that jacket? You know he's a genius. He's one of the smart people. He makes a lot of money. He's a professional. But he likes these rallies. I think it's like 279 rallies. Can you believe it? He likes Trump. He likes Trump and I like him. I feel comfortable because it's a wall. We always needed a wall. And one day I'm going to find out where you bought that suit, and I'm going to wear it to one last ... Because it's sad. We've done this for nine years. We had the greatest rallies in the history of the world. Chancellors and prime ministers, people would tell me they watch the rallies from Europe. Everybody watches our rallies. Everybody loves our rallies. We never have an empty seat.

( 01:00:50 ):

They try and demean us like that horrible, horrible person that I debated where she said, "And people leave early." Nobody leaves early. If I saw them leaving early, you know what I would say? "And ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much." I'd make America great again and I'd leave. That way they could... but I've never had to do that. I'm very capable of doing that. But nobody should say, "And people leave early." And then I hit her hard on that. I said, "No, we have the greatest rallies in the world. There's never an empty seat and nobody leaves early." And the fake news people like Brit Hume, the fake news people said, " Oh, he fell into a trap." She's got no trap. It's is not a trap.

( 01:01:35 ):

When somebody says something you have and it's wrong, you like to say, "No, that's not..." It takes about five seconds and you want to put it on the record that they're wrong, "He fell into a trap." The real trap was you had David Muir during the debate. I had the Biden debate, and that didn't work out too well for him. And then we had the other one, and I think I did better the second one with her. She talked about the grass. "What are you going to do about the economy?" "Well, I grew up in an area where I had a grass yard." I actually think in a certain way Biden was better than her. But you had David Muir. And I said, "Crime is soaring all over our nation. The migrants are pouring in." And he stops me, "Crime is not soaring. Crime is going down."

( 01:02:26 ):

Because he believed the FBI statistics, which were a fraud. And then it came out the following day that crime was in fact soaring at levels that nobody had ever seen before. They didn't include certain cities. I won't mention the cities because I have a lot of friends in those cities, but they didn't include certain cities for their statistical review. What a shame. What a shame. We need great FBI. The people in the FBI are so incredible too. I'll bet you if they took a poll in the FBI, I think I'd be at 97, 98%. I really believe it. I think I'd [inaudible 01:03:06]. But they have some people that just don't want do it. They don't want to do their job properly. It's a shame.

( 01:03:14 ):

We have a lot of things we've got to correct in this country. We have to correct him because we need honesty, we just need some basic truth. So this guy, David Muir, pretty boy, he goes, "That stuff..." I don't think he's that good looking anymore. Time does that. Time does that. No, but that's terrible. He interrupted me like what? 11 times or something. Every time I said something, "That's not true." And then he had a woman who I never heard of, don't know her name, don't want to know her name. She's not very good at what she does either. But when he didn't interrupt me, she did. And if you look, I was right just about Mr. Congressman. I think just about everything. I was right just about everything. He said, "Trump was right about everything." How about the hat? Trump was right about everything. Trump was right about everything. Now but think of it. So that must have been the first one. I followed that storm right in. But I saw the devastation. I actually came back the following week because I didn't want to get in anyone's way. It was a travesty. It was vicious. The water was the worst we'd ever seen. It was a water hurricane, that's what it was. And it took houses right off the foundations and ripped the foundations, concrete foundations like they were paper. And I saw areas that were just gone. And yet ,you've set an all time record in early voting. Think of it, the deadline you have set up until the date.

( 01:04:54 ):

Now, here are people, I'm talking about most of you who come from this area, some people are coming from outside of North Carolina, but in North Carolina, these are people that have been devastated. They've lost their homes at a minimum, especially in certain areas. They broke records in every single area. And some of the people, they didn't even have a home anymore. They were living in tents. No, but what kind...? How great...? And then those lowlifes call you garbage. No, no, think of that. Think of how bad it is. They have the nerve to say that. Think of the fact, when we were looking at the numbers in the various states and we came to North Carolina, and it just was hit by that horrible hurricane. And it just hit the hardest.

( 01:05:48 ):

Others were hit badly too, but you were just wiped out. I said, "If we get 30% of the people to vote..." And it was pretty much a Trump district, most of the area. I said, "Wow, that's bad. That's bad for a lot of reasons." Number one was it's bad, and people died. That's by far the most important. But from the standpoint of the voting, I said, "If we get 30 or 40%, that's amazing." They broke the all-time record. Think of it. Think of it. You're superior people, okay? Not garbage, you're superior people. I went to one of the big pollsters. I was talking to them right after we got those numbers because the numbers are coming in great. We're doing great in North... That doesn't mean you don't vote.

( 01:06:45 ):

Now you go on Tuesday and you just vote, vote, vote. He says, "We've got you." No, but when you think... I said to a pollster, I said, "What do you think the chances?" He said, "It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen as a pollster." And I guess some people had to come back, and you couldn't even come back because you had areas of land with no river. And now it's all of a sudden landlocked. It's all water locked. I just think it's incredible. I think it's a great tribute to North Carolina, and I'd like to thank you very much. Amazing. It's amazing. You are hearty people. You are hearty people, aren't you? She knows what I'm talking about. She knows what I'm talking about.

( 01:07:29 ):

The deadline for in-person early voting in North Carolina is Saturday. But you can do that, or you come whenever you want. I'm one that was saying... a lot of people say, "Vote early." That's great. But the main thing is vote, you got to vote. We got to vote. You got to vote. Republicans tend to vote on election day and they like to make sure. I think that that vote goes into a box somewhere, and then they want to watch where the box goes to. But you got to just vote. And I think we're going to have... this is a very important state. We win this state, we're sailing, we're sailing. We win this state, we're sailing. So if you have a ballot, send it in, or get everyone you know, vote, vote, vote. You're going to vote. And we're going to have record numbers.

( 01:08:18 ):

I think you're going to have... we're heading to record numbers in North Carolina, despite one of the worst hurricanes anyone's ever seen. And I will say this about my competition. They did a horrible job of rescue and help, one of the worst. And I don't even believe it was because it was largely a Republican area. I think they did it because they're incompetent. Okay? They did a horrible job. One of the worst jobs since Katrina. But some people say it was a worship. Nobody's even showing up. You don't even see... And then you learn that they've spent almost a billion dollars and they don't have any money for North Carolina, or Georgia, or a lot of the other states, Florida, Tennessee, South Carolina.

( 01:09:11 ):

I mean, think of it. Georgia got hit, Georgia got hit so hard. And then you listen and you find out that they don't have any money, FEMA, because they spent their money. FEMA spent money on bringing illegal aliens into our country. I'll tell you something. First of all, it's going to take a while anyway. They should be there. Nobody even sees anybody from the federal government. You know who's done a good job? Franklin Graham. He's in here. He's in here. He better do a good job. I gave him $7 million. I'm only kidding. I'm only kidding. No, we gave him a lot because he does a great job, and they have some others that do a great job. But we gave him a lot of money. Raised a lot of money for him.

( 01:10:14 ):

Because I've seen a lot of tornadoes and hurricanes and horrible storms. And every time I get there, he's always there with his crew of volunteers. It's pretty amazing actually. Franklin Graham, he does a great job. He's got good genes. He's got very good genes. My father used to take me to Yankee Stadium to watch Billy Graham fill up Yankee Stadium. He filled it up like it was nothing. My father liked going to see Billy Graham. With your help, six days from now, we're going to defeat Kamala Harris and we're going to win back that beautiful, beautiful White House. We're going to win it back. Kamala Harris cast the deciding votes that launched the worst inflation in the history of our country. She caused the typical American family over $30,000 in higher prices.

( 01:11:11 ):

They basically spent too much money and screwed up my energy policies. We had gas at $1 and 84 cents. I thought it was 187. Just came out two days ago, 184. It was lower than... A lot of people say 250. No, not 250, it's 184 a gallon. How would you like to have 184 a gallon now? We'll have it. We're going to have it again. Liquid gold, it was just announced today that economic growth missed expectations again for this quarter. It's always missing. This economy is a disaster. And now Kamala wants to raise the typical family taxes by at least $3,000 a year. If I win, we will rapidly defeat inflation. Oh, we'll have it done. So I'm going to bring your energy down to one-half of what it is now. In one year, we'll have it down 50%, and that'll bring everything else down.

( 01:12:13 ):

And we're going to bring the interest rates down, and we're going to make America affordable again. We will make America affordable again. Because we have this huge spike that took place over three years, massive spike. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. And none of that's come down. Bacon hasn't come down, apples haven't come down, lettuce, nothing's come down. People so often, they talk about groceries, they haven't come down. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses, and we will have a very special kind of a thing happen. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our seniors. None. Thank you.

[NEW_PARAGRAPH]Now, if you think, our seniors, they have a very fixed income, most of them. I'm a senior too. Somebody would say, "Oh, he's doing that. He has a conflict of interest." These fakers back here, they'll say, "He has a conflict of interest. He's a senior. He's giving himself a big tax break." No, we're not going to let that happen. But a lot of seniors have a fixed income and their social security, what's happened to all of the other things. And this will get you back to pretty much even I think by doing this. And I will support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of their parent or loved ones. And I said this almost a week ago, and guess what? Last night, Kamala said the same thing. She copied my no tax on tips. But you know what? She's not going to do it.

( 01:14:04 ):

She only said it a couple of times. She said it without... because she got killed when she said that. But now, last night, I don't know if you noticed, last night she copied my... no, she copied the caregiver statement. And let me tell you, these people that take care of their family and other people, these are incredible people, and they're entitled to it. They're entitled to it. They're got to get it starting on day one. She copied me last night, " My new administration, I will bring back energy independence like we had it." We were energy independent four years ago. Now we get our oil from Venezuela. It's called Venezuelan Tar. It comes like in tar, and you got to heat the hell out of it.

( 01:14:48 ):

And there's only one plant in the whole world that can do it, and that's located in Houston. So for the environmentalists, go take a look at those chimneys in Houston. It's not a pretty site. I will bring back energy independence and we will drill, baby drill, and we're going to start right from the beginning. And to get back our millions of jobs that have been lost, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet. That's us. But we're not going to have that good market anymore if we don't stop it right now because we're losing it. But only for those companies that make their product here in the USA and hire American workers for the job.

( 01:15:40 ):

And if these companies don't make their products here, then they will be paying a stiff tariff when they send their products into the United States for the privilege of competing with our workers and our now protected companies. They're going to pay a stiff price. They're going to pay a stiff price. We have to protect because they take our companies, they move them into Mexico. And it's pretty incredible. You heard that I knocked out the biggest auto plant anywhere in the world, I just knocked it out. I did it without even being president. I told them, they were building in Mexico, China, the largest auto plant anywhere in the world.

( 01:16:25 ):

And they were going to send those cars into us, and they were going to destroy Detroit, and they were to destroy Michigan and a little bit of South Carolina where they have sort of a different system. They were going to destroy our auto manufacturing, the little that we have left. We probably have 40% compared to what we had years ago. And they were going to destroy it. They were going to build the biggest auto plant in the world. And I heard about it through a man that was building the plant, the best in the world. He builds all the plants. I said, "I want to see a plant." He said, "You'll have to go to Mexico." I said, "I don't want to go. I want to see one here."

( 01:16:58 ):

He said, "We don't really build them here anymore. We build them in other places, but we build a lot." And Mexico's a real threat. Don't kid yourself, what they're doing in Mexico. And so I said, "I don't want to go to Mexico. What are they doing over there?" "They're building some of the biggest plants in the world. One in particular." I said, "Wow, that's no good." I thought about it. Then I spoke before the Economic Forum in Detroit, very nice group of people. And I said, "You guys are losing your shirts. And Detroit is making a comeback for 40 years. It's time now, we got to bring some companies back here."

( 01:17:31 ):

And I didn't like what I heard because when they make millions of cars out of something where you literally press a button and it makes cars, when that happens, that's no good for us because they're going to just flood the market and destroy everything that we have in Michigan and Detroit. And where you have it some, you'll do big parts business, very big parts business here. So they're going to destroy you. So I announced that I'm going to put a 100% tariff on that plant. And I saw the man about two weeks ago. He was in the audience, that man that builds the plants. And I said, "John, could I talk to you for a second?" I pull him aside, "How's that big plant coming in Mexico?" "Sir, they've decided not to build. They think you're going to become president and they'll lose their show."

( 01:18:21 ):

They're not building the plant. They're not building it, huh? Look at Emmer. Emmer likes that. Now, can you imagine that? They're not building the plant. They're not going to build the plant. And that's the way it's going to be. It's going to be real simple. And you know what? If they built the plant in this country, I'm okay with it. They can build it. They don't have any tariff to pay. They have no tariff to pay, it's very simple. And some of the deals made with these politicians, they were either really stupid or crooked as hell because this could have been done. And I've done it. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China, hundreds of billions of dollars. They'd never paid anything. They never gave one president 10 cents. I took hundreds of billions, and from other countries and we were just getting started.

( 01:19:13 ):

Anyway, we'll also pass what's known as the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act. That means if China or any other country charges us 100 or 200% tariff or tax, then we will charge them 100 or 200% tariff or tax in return. It's an eye for an eye. And I will never apologize for defending America. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs. I will protect our borders. I will protect our families. And I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth. And as we rescue our economy, I will also restore our borders. Over the past four years, you see what's been happening. It's carnage. It's carnage. It's a carnage. Kamala has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted on our people, what she's done.

( 01:20:23 ):

She's violated her oath and eradicated our sovereign border, and unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against the citizens of the United States of America. Kamala has imported criminal migrants from prisons and jails, from insane asylums and mental institutions, the most dangerous anywhere in the world, and from all around the world, from Venezuela to Congo, the Congo and Africa. They're sending us large numbers of prisoners from the Congo and Africa. Congratulations. Welcome to the United States. They're coming from the Middle East. They're coming from all over. They're coming from Europe. They're coming from Asia. A lot are coming from South America, but not all. They're coming from all over the world. They're emptying their prisons into the United States.

( 01:21:18 ):

They're emptying their mental institutions into the... They're going to be empty very soon. And what's happened to their crime rates in places like Venezuela? Whoa, way down. They've taken their street gangs and they brought them into the United States. And they said, "If you ever come back, you will die. We're going to kill you." That's what they tell them. So these are including savage criminals who assault, rape and murder our women, our girls. What they do to our families is outrageous. And my people told me, "Please, please don't say you're going to protect women. Women don't want you to say that." I said, "Really? Why? This is my geniuses. These are the people we pay all this money to give you political advice."

( 01:22:02 ):

I said, "Why?" "Women don't want to be protected, sir." I said, "Really? I don't think so. They want to be attacked by MS-13. Is that what they want? They want MS-13 to go in and knock their door down, and do bad things? No, I don't think so." I'm going to protect the women. I'm going to protect the children, and I'm going to protect the men. I'm going to protect everybody from these animals that have been unleashed into our country. And from foreign powers. Look, is there any woman in the audience, please, that does not seek protection? Please raise your hand. Is there any woman in the audience that wants to be protected? I think so. Okay, let's fire those people, please. They're all fired. They meant well.

( 01:23:04 ):

Anyone who would let monsters kidnap and kill our children does not belong anywhere near the Oval Office, and she has set a record. And today, I want you to hear something that's very disturbing. Everybody, just came out, just was done. Everybody that's heard it, I've seen tough people, very tough men literally crying, watching. And we just put it out just now. But I want you to hear it directly from a mother whose world has been shattered by the open borders insanity of Kamala Harris, please.

Video ( 01:23:45 ):

Sunday night, I asked her to not stay up super late because of her coming to work with me in the morning to do her summer school. She said, "Okay." And I told her, "Good night, and I love you." I went to bed not realizing that that was going to be the last time I saw her.

( 01:24:04 ):

We're best friends.

( 01:24:10 ):

Yeah.

( 01:24:10 ):

There we go, shake it again.

( 01:24:11 ):

I woke up to notice she wasn't in her bed. I'm in my heart trying not to lose my mind because I don't know where she is. I finally remembered her phone had a location on, and her phone was pinging just two minutes down the road, right behind the skate park. I start driving to the direction the phone was being pinged at, and I see a couple of cop cars with lights on. I see yellow tape, and immediately my heart drops and sinks to the bottom of my stomach. My daughter's hands and ankles were both bound. She was strangled to death, left with no pants. And I know in my heart she fought incredibly hard. She was not going down without a fight.

( 01:25:11 ):

We begin with two men we're learning are charged with capital murder tonight, accused of killing a 12-year-old girl.

( 01:25:17 ):

Police say these men strangled her before dumping her into that creek. Both men were in the country illegally.

( 01:25:23 ):

Apprehended, then released by border patrol less than three weeks before Jocelyn's death. The men accused of killing Jocelyn Nungaray are affiliated with the gang known for brutal violence.

( 01:25:34 ):

Kamala Harris was in charge of immigration and our borders. If we had better border policies and not open borders, and not these catch-and-release policies, I truly believe this all could have been prevented. Under her being vice president of this country, my daughter's life was ripped away from her. She had her entire life. I've had her...

( 01:26:04 ):

Happy birthday dear Jocelyn.

( 01:26:06 ):

My daughter is six feet in the ground based off of policies that she allowed to keep. Kamala Harris did have one job, and she not only failed, not me, she failed my daughter. She failed Jocelyn. She was only 12. President Trump reached out, gave me his sincerest condolences as not a former president, but just as a father, someone who cares. I believe Donald Trump needs to be back in office. I can at least know that my next child will be safe in this country.

Donald Trump ( 01:26:07 ):

Donald Trump ( 01:27:00 ):

Just no reason for it. Thank you very much. No reason. There's no reason for that. Thank you very much. But there's no reason for that. Open borders. Open borders. Anybody comes in, doesn't matter where you come from. They don't even know where they come from. They don't check them. They don't know where they come... Are they from jails? They don't know anything about them. They just let them pour into our country. It's incredible.

( 01:27:25 ):

Now she's sort of stopped it by doing just a little bit because she was getting killed in the polls. And if they ever won, they would open those borders and you would have millions and millions more people come in and there'd be criminals. If I ran one of the countries that we're talking about, and over the last few months it was 181 different countries. Most people don't even know there are that many. There are actually more. 181 countries were represented and they're letting their criminals and their jails and everything into our country. They're destroying our country. They're destroying our country and we can't take it any longer. We have to change. We have to change immediately. I think it's the biggest problem.

( 01:28:07 ):

I think it's bigger than the economy. I think it's bigger than inflation because they're ruining the fabric of our country. You're not going to be able to walk out of your house no matter where you live, if you're in a farm. They're flying people in with the big Boeing jets, the biggest ones, and they're taking hundreds of them in. They're landing in the Midwest and all over the place. They're flying them right over the border. They're sick. The day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. The savages charged with brutalizing and murdering precious Jocelyn are members of the same vicious Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua, that's taken over apartment complexes and unleashing a violent killing spree all over America. You've read about them in Colorado, Aurora, Colorado. They've taken over complexes. They've taken them away from landlords. They've told people to get out. They've told the people you pay us the rent from now on. You don't pay it to a landlord. You don't pay it to a property owner. You pay it to us. They've even taken over Times Square. Take a look.

Speaker 9 ( 01:29:22 ):

Open borders, deadly consequences.

Speaker 10 ( 01:29:24 ):

Border crisis. Record high crossings are putting a strain on cities across America.

Speaker 11 ( 01:29:30 ):

It is a full-blown invasion.

Speaker 12 ( 01:29:31 ):

Armed Venezuelan gang members storming an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado.

Speaker 13 ( 01:29:36 ):

When people talk about migrant crime, this is what they're talking about.

Speaker 14 ( 01:29:39 ):

San Antonio, Texas, just one of the latest cities to have apartment complexes taken over by members of the Venezuelan gang.

Speaker 15 ( 01:29:46 ):

Biden and Harris have created a program to bring them in under humanitarian parole.

Kamala Harris ( 01:29:51 ):

I am in favor of saying that we're not going to treat people who are undocumented cross the border as criminals.

Speaker 16 ( 01:29:56 ):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been released into the United States.

Speaker 17 ( 01:30:02 ):

My 20-year-old daughter Kayla Hamilton was murdered in her own room. Kayla's murderer was apprehended by Border Patrol crossing illegally into the U.S.

Speaker 18 ( 01:30:11 ):

Kayla's murderer had been improperly released into the United States.

Speaker 19 ( 01:30:15 ):

Abolish ICE.

Kamala Harris ( 01:30:16 ):

Yeah, we need to probably think about starting from scratch.

Speaker 20 ( 01:30:18 ):

More than a dozen people suspected of being Tren de Aragua gang members right here in San Antonio.

Speaker 21 ( 01:30:23 ):

The gang members had been terrorizing the apartment complex.

Speaker 22 ( 01:30:26 ):

New details in the murder of Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national.

Speaker 23 ( 01:30:34 ):

And was paroled and released into the country by the Biden administration.

Bill Clinton ( 01:30:38 ):

If they'd all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened.

Speaker 24 ( 01:30:40 ):

Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 25 ( 01:30:47 ):

Martinez-Rangel wrapped his arms around Jocelyn's neck, took off her pants and climbed on top of her, later strangled Jocelyn to death and then tied up her hands and feet.

Speaker 26 ( 01:30:57 ):

Court documents suggest a group of men arrested for beating and robbing a Dallas woman last month are members of a Venezuelan street gang.

Speaker 27 ( 01:31:04 ):

The men threatened to cut off her fingers if she did not cooperate. Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez was booked by Colleyville police just two days earlier and released the day before the robbery.

Speaker 28 ( 01:31:15 ):

A Peruvian gang leader who was wanted for 23 murders who was arrested by Border Patrol near Roma, Texas, then released into America.

Donald Trump ( 01:31:29 ):

This is what we have coming into our country. The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer. We will not let this happen. November 5, 2024 will be liberation day in America. It'll be liberation day. On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. I will rescue every city and town that's been invaded and conquered and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of our country. And to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and MS-13 and all of these gangs that are now living happily in our country, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, can you believe that, to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement official. And I will immediately ban all sanctuary cities in the United States of America. With their open borders, they're going to destroy your Social Security and Medicare. They're going to destroy our healthcare. But I'm going to save it all and I'm going to save our country. That's what we're going to do. These people are all signing up.

( 01:33:32 ):

Kamala's gross incompetence, she's a grossly incompetent person, disqualifies her from being President of the United States. Everyone knows it. No one respects her. No one trusts her. No one takes her seriously. To make her president would be to gamble with the lives of millions and millions of people. She would get us into World War III because she is too grossly incompetent to do the job. And then all of your sons and daughters will end up getting draft notice, as they'll come, "Mommy, daddy, what does this mean?" "Son," even daughter, "that means that you're going to be drafted to fight in a war against a country that you've never heard of. Congratulations, son." And it may be the last time you ever see them.

( 01:34:22 ):

We're not going to let that happen anymore in this country. Our enemies are laughing at her. If we win, America will be feared and respected again on issue after issue. Kamala broke it and I will fix it and I'll fix it quickly. On top of it all, Kamala says she would not do one thing differently from Joe Biden, which in itself is disqualifying. Take a look.

Speaker 29 ( 01:34:53 ):

Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?

Kamala Harris ( 01:35:00 ):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 30 ( 01:35:02 ):

I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.

Speaker 31 ( 01:35:04 ):

The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan stunned Americans and the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.

Speaker 29 ( 01:35:12 ):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris ( 01:35:14 ):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 16 ( 01:35:16 ):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught at the border and then released into the United States.

Speaker 32 ( 01:35:24 ):

An Afghan national is in custody the day after being accused of plotting an election day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

Speaker 22 ( 01:35:32 ):

Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.

Speaker 24 ( 01:35:44 ):

Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 33 ( 01:35:51 ):

A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.

Speaker 29 ( 01:35:59 ):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris ( 01:36:01 ):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 28 ( 01:36:03 ):

Only 18% say the economy is in excellent or good condition.

Speaker 34 ( 01:36:07 ):

US inflation has hit a new 40-year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.

Speaker 35 ( 01:36:13 ):

Authorities say Tren de Aragua, which has been linked with more than a hundred criminal investigations here in the US, has now been found operating its criminal enterprise in apartment complexes.

Speaker 36 ( 01:36:24 ):

Were you the last person in the room?

Kamala Harris ( 01:36:25 ):

Yes.

Donald Trump ( 01:36:31 ):

There is not a thing that comes to mind. So maybe the worst thing that we can be talking about, 325,000 children that the press never talks about. 325,000 children have come into our country and they're now missing. They're going to be dead or they're going to be sex slaves or slaves of some kind. 325,000 children. Many of them are dead. And she said, "There's not a thing that comes to mind."

( 01:37:04 ):

Just like she's a fraud. She's a total fraud. She's a liar. She even lied about McDonald's, didn't she? But she's a total liar. They lied about 818,000 jobs that they said we built up over the course of their wonderful management that turned out to be a total fraud. And they weren't going to announce that until after the election, but we had a whistleblower that called them in. You remember that just a few months ago, they said 818,000 jobs were created and they weren't. They're fake jobs. And they were going to release the correct information. They were going to do a little deletion and they were going to release it right after the election, but they got caught. We can't let ourselves be duped by these people. These are criminal people as far as I'm concerned.

( 01:37:58 ):

We're thrilled to be joined by representatives and they're great warriors and they're friends of mine and they fight side by side. Congressman Richard Hudson. Richard, thank you very much. Great job he's doing. One of the most powerful people in Washington, a great congressman, Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. Thank you, Tom. And another great friend is Byron Donalds. He's fantastic. Fantastic. And you have a congressional candidate that I know is going to win. She's up in the polls. She's doing great. Laurie Buckhout. She's fantastic. And she's got my complete and total endorsement. And somebody that is a star, although I'll let you know that on the sixth. Is that okay? But I think he's a star. North Carolina GOP chair, Jason Simmons. Jason, thank you. Great.

( 01:39:14 ):

So I also want to say hello to Keith Kellogg, General Kellogg. He's one of our really great generals. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Keith. Been with me right from the beginning, right? From day one. And my son- in-law Michael. Michael is a fantastic young guy. I have to introduce him. Thank you, Michael. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michael.

( 01:39:39 ):

I also want to send our prayers to everyone in North Carolina and other states still recovering from the hurricanes. If I win, we will get them and we will support you. On January 20th, it's not too far away anymore. January 20th is when you take office. We'll have people here so much, you will say, "Please, we got too many people. Get them out of here. We have too many people."

( 01:40:02 ):

We had great success with FEMA. It would be amazing. It's been acknowledged that the hurricane rescue effort and rebuilding effort is the worst that we've just about ever seen outside of maybe Katrina, but I think it was worse. There's nobody even here. And the devastation is incredible. And how the hell could you vote for somebody that's in charge of it? Right? So I don't think you're going to vote for Kamala.

( 01:40:36 ):

Here are the facts. Kamala is a radical left Marxist rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders or Pocahontas herself. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of defund the police movement and anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week or one day is not worthy of being President of the United States. Kamala vowed to abolish ICE, our great heroes of ICE. As California Attorney General, she redefined child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon, and rape of an unconscious person as totally nonviolent crimes. She pledged to confiscate your guns and endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. Would anybody in North Carolina want to give up your guns quietly?

( 01:41:42 ):

Oh, it could have had an impact on my hearing for the rest of my life. That's not going to be an easy job, is it? No, but that's where comes from. She even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens and detention at taxpayer expense. So in conclusion, with your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America. Going to get her out. Going to get her out, right? The man. We're going to get her out. We will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to North Carolina where they belong.

( 01:42:33 ):

And I have a little personal favor that I'm going to do, North Carolina. I'm going to get your furniture builders and artists and manufacturers, we're going to bring them back. They left you for China. They're going to be coming back because this is where they want to be. I came down here so many times. I'd build a hotel. I'd say, "I want to go to North Carolina." I came so much. I'd say, "No, I'd like the arm to be a little bit, on that chair a little da, da, bim, bim, bim." These guys were so good. And now you have just a fraction of what you had. You're the best in the world.

( 01:43:09 ):

I'd buy from China and then they'd sit in the chair. Then the chair would collapse and I'd get sued. This is true. They'd sue me because the damn chair would break at a hotel. Mr. Jones would sit down. He's slightly overweight, like about 200 pounds. He'd sit in that chair and the thing collapses. The next thing I know, "Sir, you've been sued by Mr. Jones of someplace." No, you built the greatest furniture in the world and you're going to be doing it again. You're doing it a little bit, but you're going to be doing it again.

( 01:43:41 ):

We will build American, we will buy American, and we will hire American. I will end the war in Ukraine. Would've never started if I were president. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East and I will prevent World War III from happening. I will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect that they so dearly deserve. We're going to take care of our police.

( 01:44:12 ):

We will strengthen and modernize our military. I rebuilt our military and they gave a lot of it away to a place called Afghanistan in the most embarrassing moment of our country's life. We will build a missile defense shield massively. We are going to build the greatest, the biggest missile defense shield. A lot of it's going to be made right in the USA. It's all going to be made in the USA. It's going to be made right here though a lot of it.

( 01:44:39 ):

We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington D.C., which is horribly run, which is filthy dirty with graffiti all over columns and lions and everything else. And we're going to take care of our capital. We're going to make it beautiful and safe. We're not going to have people being killed there. But we're going to make our cities beautiful, clean, safe again. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we will get critical race theory and transgender insanity out of our schools and we will keep men out of women's sports if that's okay.

( 01:45:28 ):

I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment. And I have everybody's endorsement, including the NRA and always have had it. And it is under siege. Your Second Amendment is under siege.

( 01:45:50 ):

After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country, defend our borders, and protect our citizens. And we will stop illegal immigration once and for all. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be overrun. We will not be conquered. We will not be conquered. They are conquering us. They are conquering us from within. We will be a free and proud nation once again. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope and will be filled also with a thing called the American Dream, something you don't hear about so much anymore.

( 01:46:42 ):

But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig. You need to get out and vote. That's all I... You don't have to give me money. You don't have to give me anything. Just go out and vote. Who has voted so far? Who is going to vote? Okay, get out every vote. Thank you very much. That's very impressive.

( 01:47:14 ):

For the past nine years, we have been fighting against the most sinister and corrupt forces on earth. With your vote this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. Belongs to you. You guys. It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country and six days from now, it is hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country.

( 01:47:46 ):

After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help from now until election day, six days, we will restore America's promise and we will take back the nation that we all love. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down and we will never, ever surrender.

( 01:48:18 ):

Together, we will fight, fight, fight and win, win, win. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you.
