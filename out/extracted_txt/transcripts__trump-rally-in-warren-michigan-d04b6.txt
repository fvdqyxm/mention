Lorenzo Sewell ( 00:00 ):

I want to talk to you about all those who would say, "Pastor, I'm afraid." How many know that the Bible says 365 times, do not fear? Somebody say, "I will not be afraid. I will not be afraid." Why? Because we're going to fight, fight, fight. There's no reason for you to be afraid because we're going to fight, fight, fight. We believe that God can do more than we can ask our think. Why? Because we're going to fight, fight, fight.

( 00:34 ) Would you pray with me? Come on, Macomb County, would you lift your hands? And when you open up your mouth, Father, in the name of Jesus, we pray that you would do the impossible. We do not fight in our own effort. We do not fight in our own power. We fight by the power of the Spirit of the Lord, and we believe the battle is not ours, the battle is yours, and we believe that we have already won. We don't have to be afraid because we will fight, fight, fight, because you love this country. We know you care about this country. We know you are dispatching angels for our country. So we'll give you all the glory, we'll give you all the honor, and we'll give you all the praise. In the name of Jesus, we pray, amen and amen. Put your hands together, and give your great God great glory.

Speaker 1 ( 01:58 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Ronald Singer.

Ronald Singer ( 02:33 ):

How do you follow that? I don't know where to start. Maybe I should just leave now. Hello, everybody. I am honored to be here today. I'm Ron Singer, an army veteran, an auto engineer, and now a candidate for state rep right here in Macomb County's District 13.

( 03:04 ) As a lifelong Michigander, I understand the challenges our families face, especially as costs keep rising. Lansing Democrats hike taxes, hurting Macomb families, and it's hitting our community hard. I'm committed to reversing that tax hike and fighting for real affordability for Macomb families so that every paycheck goes a little further and every family has an opportunity to not just survive but to thrive. As a strong supporter of President Trump, I believe in America First values, securing the southern border, respecting the rule of law, honoring those who were willing to give the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms. With that in mind, let's remember what we're all fighting for, as we say the Pledge of Allegiance, our country, our values, and our future. Please rise, join me in the pledge.

Audience ( 04:20 ):

I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

Speaker 1 ( 05:03 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Vanessa Carr.

Vanessa Carr ( 05:38 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please stand for our National Anthem.

MUSIC ( 05:50 ):

O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

( 06:16 ) I said upside down you're turning me, you're giving love instinctively, around and round you're turning me. Upside down, boy, you turn me, inside out and round and round. Upside down, boy, you turn me, inside out and round and round. Instinctively, you give to me the love that I need. I cherish the moments with you. Respectfully, I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin' when no one makes me feel like you do.

( 08:57 ) Upside down, boy, you turn me, inside out and round and round. Upside down, boy, you turn me, inside out and round and round. I know you got charm and appeal. You always play the field. I'm crazy to think you're all mine. As long as the sun continues to shine, there's a place in my heart for you that's the bottom line.

( 09:31 ) Upside down, boy, you turn me, inside out and round and round. Upside down, boy, you turn me, inside out and round and round. Instinctively, you give to me the love that I need, I cherish the moment with you. Respectfully, I see to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin', but no one makes me feel like you do. Upside down, boy, you turn…

Speaker 1 ( 10:17 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, U.S. Senate candidate, Mike Rogers.

Mike Rogers ( 10:52 ):

All right, are y'all fired up? You ready to give a Macomb welcome to the next President of the United States, Donald Trump? All right.

( 11:03 ) I'm going to take one point of personal privilege here. I'm going to ask veterans to stand up, but there's a special veteran in this crowd. My son just finished his fifth year, and he is separating from military service, but he's here with us today. All of our veterans, stand up. John Rogers, way to go, thank you for your service. Thank you, veterans, all of you, appreciate it very much. I know what you're thinking, "He's an army guy. How did he get a Navy son?" I have no idea how I screwed that up, but…

( 11:43 ) So a couple of things we need to get straight as well. I'm tired of hearing our national pundits call this the Rust Belt. I don't know about you all. We are the work belt in this country. And I tell you, the Democrats are very proud of the people they're dragging out, mostly from Hollywood, New York, and places like that. Yeah, you bet. So let me tell you this. They may have Beyonce, but we got auto workers. They may have Bruce Springsteen, we got teamsters. They brought out recently to Michigan Sarah Jessica Parker. But let me tell you who we have, we have farmers, we have gold-star parents. We have the families of the victims of fentanyl that have been brought to us by a wide open and dangerous border brought to you by the Democratic Party here in Michigan and across the country.

( 13:10 ) So you think about the things that we do have. We have people who get up every day and go to work. We have people who care about this country. We have people who think it's okay to be patriotic to the United States of America. So help me do this. The last few years have been tough on a lot of us. First time in a long time, we've had so many problems, economic and otherwise. I know some of you have voted. We need you to find someone else that hasn't voted and get them to the poll. Yeah, you bet. If we show up, we will win on Tuesday. We will win on Tuesday. So help me do this, on November 5th, with a strong showing and your good work in the last and final days, we are going to tell our auto workers, "Come November 5th, we will have your back." We're going to tell our teamster brothers and sisters, " Come November 5th, we will have your back." We're going to tell police officers, who have been treated like doormats after November 5th, "We will have your back." We will tell that struggling family, who is taking groceries off of the conveyor belt and put it back in the cart because they can't afford it after the bill's rung up, because of their Democrat policies and spending and regulation and taxes, "Come November, we will have your back."

( 15:11 ) And lastly, for the men and women who are standing tall all around the world in defense of this great nation, who are hoping that they will have a military service worthy of their service, to those men and women who have the courage to stand up, let's do this for them. Let's tell them on November 5th, "We will have your back." Let's get this done. Let's win for Donald Trump. Let's win for America. God bless you.

Speaker 1 ( 16:29 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Auto Workers for Trump, Brian Pannebecker.

MUSIC ( 16:39 ):

Here I am, rock you like a hurricane. Here I am, rock you like a hurricane. Are you ready, baby? Here I am, rock you like a hurricane. Here I am…

Brian Pannebecker ( 17:05 ):

Thank you, Macomb County. It's really special for me to be able to speak to you here in Macomb County. I was born and raised here. I worked 36 years for Chrysler Corporation, and then Ford Motor Company. I could ride my bicycle to the Ford plant I worked 25 years at. It was that close to my home. So I am Macomb County through and through, and I know what makes you people feel good about this country. It's getting up, going to work, doing a good job, bringing home a paycheck, and putting food on the table for your family. Now, you've been called names by the candidate, you've been called names by the President of the United States, but I know who you are. You're hard-working patriots. So listen, real quick, I started a group called Auto Workers for Trump, and I got to meet candidate Donald Trump out in Novi in 2016. And I told him about you guys. I told him about these guys back here behind me. I said, "Mr. Trump, we have the keys to the White House waiting for you in Macomb County." And we do, we do, it just depends on all of you.

( 18:31 ) So Trump's got a pretty good sense of humor, and he laughed. He said, "Oh yeah, how's that?" And I said, "Well, Macomb County is the home of the Reagan Democrats." That's these guys right here. Their union leaders for decades lied to them and told them if they voted Democrat, the Democrat party would protect their jobs. Well, around 1980, when Ronald Reagan ran, they started to wake up and realize that that was a lie. But we've woken up, and in the 40 years since 1980, we have become a solid voting block, the auto workers have for Republican candidates. And that support went up about 10 points when Donald Trump ran for office in 2016.

( 19:25 ) Well, we shocked Hillary Clinton, and she didn't even bother to come here and campaign. She never stepped foot in Wisconsin. She thought she had the Rust Belt states under her belt. And we proved her wrong when Trump won Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and the great state of Michigan.

( 19:51 ) So Donald Trump won that election. He came here, we packed 15,000 people into Freedom Hill, where the capacity is only 7,500, but it's an outdoor arena, like most of you know. And the fire marshals just kept packing them in, packing them in. So we flipped that. We flipped Michigan, we flipped Macomb County, and this is the county that put Donald Trump over the top in 2016.

( 20:23 ) Now, we're going to do it again. We're going to do it again. And Lara Trump and Michael Whatley, the national co-chairs for the campaign, have a great get-out-the-vote plan and we're implementing it, but it depends on all of you. How many of you have already voted? Beautiful, beautiful. How many of you have got to vote yet, tomorrow and Sunday early? Okay, make sure you get out and vote. And then everybody that's voted in person early, you got to contact 10 people out of your phone list. Make sure every single one of them gets out and votes this weekend. I'm not talking about Tuesday, I'm talking about Saturday and Sunday. A lot of people don't know about early in-person voting. You can vote on the weekends. We've got to do it. So go through your phone list, get all your family, your friends, your neighbors, your co-workers, like I got behind me right here, and tell them they got to get out and vote this weekend.

( 21:28 ) Macomb County is going to put Donald Trump over the top. And when they call Michigan, when Wolf Blitzer says, "Well, we can now call Michigan for Donald J. Trump," you can brush your teeth and go to bed, game over, we're going to put them over the top. Thank you. Now, get out there and get to work.

Speaker 1 ( 21:52 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Congressman John James.

MUSIC ( 21:52 ):

They wanna get my, they wanna get my gold on the ceiling. I ain't blind, just a matter of time before you steal it. It's alright, ain't no guardin' my…

Congressman John James ( 23:35 ):

Good afternoon, Macomb County. How you doing today? Thank you all so much for being here to welcome the 45th and the future 47th President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump. Look, I can't speak too long because we're almost out of time. Lions fans, this is no longer the two-minute warning. We are on the one-yard line. This is the final play of the game in the last four days here. Our fellow conservatives are voting early and submitting their absentee ballots in record numbers. So if you haven't yet, please vote early so we can save America and re-elect President Donald Trump.

( 24:25 ) Folks, everything is on the line in this election, our futures, our children's futures, our children's children's futures. What will you be able to say to your grandkids when they ask you what you did on November 5th, 2024? I want to hear it from you. Will you be able to say that you ended Kamala Harris' border crisis? Will you be able to say that you voted to keep manufacturing jobs in Michigan and usher in another golden age in American history under President Trump? Will you be able to say that you voted to end crime at home and end wars abroad? Will you be able to say to your grandkids, I voted for Donald? There you go.

( 25:14 ) Democrats have tried to kick Trump off the ballot, seize his assets, and lock him up. They're letting non-Michiganders and a Chinese national vote in this election, and they want to use-

Audience ( 25:25 ):

Boo.

Congressman John James ( 25:26 ):

That's right. That's right. Their hateful rhetoric has led to two assassination attempts, and they want to call him a threat to democracy. Well, who's the real threat to democracy? Michigan, this election is the Pepsi Challenge. We've seen both candidates in the White House, one candidate was great and did great things for America, and the other tastes like, well, garbage.

( 25:58 ) And that's the thing, when we all vote tomorrow, when we all vote on Sunday or on Tuesday, we don't have to imagine a better tomorrow. We don't have to imagine a better America. We just have to remember. We just have to remember that, under Trump, we'll secure our borders and deport the over 100,000 convicted criminals that have gotten into our country under Kamala Harris. We'll restore hope in the American dream and create economy where all Americans can get ahead.

( 26:29 ) And in an area where Carl Marlinga called automotive a dying industry, and Kamala Harris wants to put a final nail in the coffin, we will end the electric vehicle mandates that will crater Michigan's economy and take your choice away. And as a combat veteran and as a father of three sons, we will restore peace at home and abroad, and end these wars. And when we do all of that, because of your efforts to vote, we will make America great once again because of you. So with this, I say my brothers and sisters, welcome to the great 10th Congressional District. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. That's why.

Speaker 1 ( 27:20 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stage, Congresswoman Lisa McClain.

MUSIC ( 28:18 ):

It was a beautiful day, don't let it get away. Beautiful day. Touch me, take me to that other place. Reach me, I know I'm not a hopeless case.

Congresswoman Lisa McClain ( 28:45 ):

My goodness gracious, it's good to be home in Macomb. How's everybody doing today? Michiganders, this election will be decided right here by voters in Macomb. President Trump knows that, JD Vance knows that, that's why they've been here every single week.

( 29:14 ) But let's take a look at Kamala's campaign for one moment. Kamala, boo, yeah. Kamala and her cronies have turned to bullying, and that's really hurtful for me. They're telling us how they truly feel about us. They tell us we're deplorables. They tell us we're garbage. And they call us dumb, weak women. Well, let me tell you, I can tell you, I am not a deplorable, I am not garbage, and I certainly am not a dumb or weak woman. How many of you strong women are with me right now? That's right.

( 30:29 ) I mean, really, what happened to Kamala's campaign of joy? It kind of went out the window, didn't it? Kamala's campaign has turned into a campaign of division, lies, and contradictions. One minute, she's for fracking, the next minute, not so much. One day, she wants to secure our border, the next day, she wants amnesty.

Audience ( 30:59 ):

Chameleon.

Congresswoman Lisa McClain ( 30:59 ):

That's right. It kind of reminds me of that Boy George song << Karma, karma, karma, karma, karma chameleon >> Right? Well, do you know why she has to lie? She has to lie because if she told the truth, no one would vote for her. Well, if the Democrats and Kamala Harris are going to lie about Donald Trump and the Republicans, I think it's about time we start telling the truth about them.

( 31:36 ) Folks, there's only one question you have to ask yourself, and it's really simple, and we probably can answer that. Are you better off now, or were you better off four years ago under President Donald J. Trump? We all know the answer to that one.

( 31:56 ) When President Trump was in office, inflation, 1.4%, our borders, secure. He added over a half a million manufacturing jobs. That's right. That's right. And what did Kamala do? She reversed those policies, her and Joe Biden reversed those policies on day one. Since then, inflation has skyrocketed. Millions of illegals had poured into our country, and wars are raging overseas. They ruined our safety, they ruined our security, and they ruined the success that we had under President Trump. I think it's time we bring President Donald J. Trump back where he belongs, and that's 1600 Pennsylvania

Congresswoman Lisa McClain ( 33:00 ):

… Pennsylvania Avenue. Think about it for one moment. Any normal person that has been through what President Trump has been through, a biased media, attacks on his family, and two assassination attempts, they would've given up. But he didn't. And you know why? Because he loves this country and he's willing to fight for this country and he's willing to fight to give you all and your children and grandchildren a better America.

( 33:48 ) Michiganders understand that the failed Biden/Harris policies of the past four years have done nothing for them. We want to return to the prosperity that we had under President Trump. Well, folks, let me tell you, if Kamala Harris gets her way, it will be four more years of failed policies that have wrecked our country and left our economy bankrupt.

( 34:20 ) In fact, we've already seen the effects in Michigan. Inflation is costing Michiganders over $1,000 more a month. And that is not good for you, it's not good for your family. Think about it, inflation seems to be the top issue for all of us here in Macomb County. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris sponsored AOC's Green New Deal. She was the deciding vote. She wants to kill American energy and Kamala supports EV mandates that Americans don't want. Macomb County knows what EV mandates do to our community. They kill jobs. Your jobs. In fact, Stellantis just laid off 2,000 workers right here in Macomb County.

( 35:22 ) So I got an idea. She's coming after your jobs. So I got an idea, how about you stop prioritizing climate activists and prioritizing and start prioritizing hard-working American people like all of us here? How about we have just a little bit of faith that you know what car you want drive and what stove you want in your kitchen?

( 35:59 ) You and I both know that the Democrats' agenda is not built around you. That's why it's time we bring back real leaders to the White House. And, folks, those leaders are President Donald J. Trump, J.D. Vance, Mike Rogers and John James. Unlike Joe and Kamala's failed record, listen to what President Trump's done. He brought back jobs. He brought back jobs right here to Macomb County. He brought back factories. And President Trump brought back industry to the good old US of A. President Trump delivered for Michigan and he put you first, Michigan first, and America first. Now I got a question for you: Who all liked paying a buck-fifty for gas? Kind of nice. A little bit better than the 3.50 we got to pay now. Who else liked putting 30 more percent groceries in their grocery cart? Since Biden and Harris has taken office, prices on everything has gone up, up, up.

( 37:28 ) So listen, please, if you want a ticket that's going to bring down prices, actually cut your taxes, and put our economy back on track, I am asking you to stand with me, stand with President Trump and put President Donald J. Trump back in that White House where he belongs. No matter how much Kamala lies, and Lord knows she's got a few doozies in her repertoire, we know her record and we know what she'll do. And why do we know what she'll do? Because she's done it for the past three-and-a-half years.

( 38:21 ) Kamala was voted the most liberal US Senator. She's not changing her spots, ladies and gentlemen. Listen, she wants free healthcare for illegals. What about our veterans? Where do they rank? She wants to abolish ICE. Remember, she's the one that helped bail out the rioters. Kamala is pro-criminal and anti-law enforcement. And while we're here, I think it's only right to say thank you to our law enforcement agents that are here today.

( 39:18 ) Thank you. And thank you for keeping our president safe.

( 39:26 ) Theses are all Left-Wing policies that Kamala supports, and it's no surprise since she's from California. But I got a great idea, on November 6th, 5th, excuse me. On November 5th, why don't we send her a message and send her back to California where she belongs?

( 39:52 ) If there's one thing that I know, it's the road to the White House runs through Michigan. This campaign has been a marathon and it's not quite over yet. We got four more days, but we have to get out and vote. Take your friends, take your relatives, take your coworkers, make sure they vote. Trump won here in '16. And with all of your help, he's going to win here again. So make sure you vote Trump and Vance so we can save our country and make America great again.

( 40:38 ) Thank you all. God bless you. God bless Michigan. God bless the United States of America. Get out and vote. Put Donald Trump back in the White House.

( 01:23:57 ) It's close to midnight, and something evil's lurking in the dark.

( 01:23:57 ) Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart.

( 01:23:59 ) You try to scream, but terror takes the sound before you make it.

( 01:23:59 ) And you start to freeze, as horror looks you right between eyes, you're paralyzed. 'Cause this is thriller, thriller night.

( 01:24:00 ) And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike.

( 01:24:00 ) You know it's thriller, thriller night.

( 01:24:00 ) You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah.

( 01:24:00 ) Ooh.

( 01:24:00 ) You hear the door slam, and realize there's nowhere left to run.

( 01:24:00 ) You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you ever see the sun.

( 01:24:00 ) You close your eyes, and hope that is just a imagination, girl.

( 01:24:00 ) But all the while, you hear a creature creepin' up behind, you're out of time. 'Cause this is thriller, thriller night.

( 01:28:30 ) There ain't no second chance, against the thing with forty eyes, girl.

( 01:28:30 ) Thriller, Ooh, thriller night.

( 01:28:30 ) You're fighting for your life inside a killer…

( 01:28:48 ) This is a man's world.

( 01:28:49 ) This is a man's world.

( 01:28:49 ) But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.

( 01:29:05 ) You see, man made the cars, to take over the road.

( 01:29:05 ) Man made the train, to carry the heavy load.

( 01:29:05 ) Man made the electric light, to take us out of the dark.

( 01:29:05 ) Man made the boat for the water, my Bible said Noah made the ark.

( 01:29:05 ) This is a man's world, but it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, nothing without a woman-

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Senator Markwayne Mullen.

MUSIC ( 01:30:12 ):

Taking care of business (every day).

( 01:30:12 ) Taking care of business (every way).

( 01:30:12 ) I've been taking care of business (it's all mine).

( 01:30:12 ) Taking care of business (every way).

( 01:30:12 ) Taking care of business and working overtime.

Senator Markwayne Mullen. ( 01:30:40 ):

What's going on everybody? First of all, thank you so much for being here. Can I ask all of our veterans, and current service members to stand up? Stand up. What's up?

( 01:30:53 ) Now, I want all the veterans, and all the current service members, I want you to look around, because we're all saying thank you. Because without you guys going and serving the country, willing to put your life on the line, none of us would be here. So God bless you all. Thank you so much for your service. Thank you. We all need to give them a big round of… We need it all to stand up. Seriously. Everybody stand up and tell them thank you now. Say, thank you.

( 01:31:35 ) All right, guys. Now the real question is, why are we all here? We're here because we're all fed up. We all know that the Harris-Biden administration has failed America. And we need a fighter to fight for us, right? We need someone that's going to fight back against the overreaching arms of the federal government. And I know just the guy, don't you? Our fighter is President Trump, and not only can he take the fight to him, but he will win the fight.

( 01:32:19 ) Now, as a former fighter myself, I know a little bit, just a little bit, about fighting. And I know a fighter when I see one. Our fighter, the country's fighter, the fighter that's going to bring down inflation, the fighter that's going to bring back our energy independence, the fighter that's going to secure our borders, the man that showed great leadership and courage during an assassination attempt, the man that stood up and raised his fist in the middle of the air for all Americans and said, "Fight, fight, fight." That's my friend. That's our president. And that's soon to be the 47th President of the United States. And we need him because we need him to bring back America. We need to come back and make America great again.

( 01:33:50 ) So guys, literally, from the deepest part of my heart, thank you so much for being here. Thank you for willing to take a stand and say, no, no, our country's going in the wrong direction. It is time to bring back the man. So may God bless you, may God bless President Trump, and may God bless United States of America.

Speaker 2 ( 01:34:50 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage United States Senator Eric Schmidt.

Senator Eric Schmidt ( 01:35:17 ):

How are we doing? You guys ready to save America? We're just a few days away. We are just a few days away. Look at all the joy in this room. There's so much joy. This is the joyful campaign. This is the fun campaign, ain't it? It's also the time in the campaign where you see who the real players are, right? The real players. Kamala Harris reminds me of the backup quarterback. And backup quarterbacks can be kind of popular until they get in the game. And then you realize why the backup quarterback wasn't the starting quarterback. She is not ready for prime time. In fact, she's in a friendly interview with the view, and they ask her, "Was there anything that you would do differently over the last four years than Joe Biden?" "Nothing comes to mind." Well, that sounds about right.

( 01:36:20 ) But it's worse than that, because what we had when President Trump left office was a border that was more secure than it had been in 45 years, working families across this state and across the country were making more money. They could afford the food on the table, they could afford the car insurance. For all the things that's part of the American dream that now every single week there's sticker shock. It doesn't have to be this way. And their ideas are more radical than that, folks. If they get into office again, Kamala Harris fully supports taxpayer funded sex change operations for illegal immigrants, and prisoners. Those are her words.

( 01:37:02 ) When she was in the US Senate, she was more radical than Bernie Sanders, to give you some idea. Now, look, before this job, I had a different job. I was the attorney general of Missouri, and we sued the vaccine mandate. We took it all the way to the Supreme Court, and we won. We sued on the student loan debt forgiveness scam. We took it to the Supreme Court, and we won. I was the guy that sued big tech for the vast censorship enterprise in Missouri versus Biden. So I know something about what it means to fight, and I've never seen a fighter like this guy, you're going to welcome on the stage, Donald J. Trump.

( 01:37:50 ) When he was shot at, just a couple of months ago, his first instinct was to stand up, and yell, "Fight, fight, fight." So how do we honor that? Well, we're here today. But that's not enough, because if you haven't voted already, or you have voted, you need to vote, obviously. This is get out the vote time. You need to vote. But after all these great speeches are over with, get on your phone, text 10 people that you don't think have voted. Make sure your family members vote.

( 01:38:22 ) Because we can have good polls and we can have great rallies, and they're all very important, but the only poll that really matters is on Tuesday night, when we elect President Trump the 47th President of the United States. Ladies and gentlemen, let's go do this. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Let's go.

MUSIC ( 01:38:42 ):

Don't let it get away.

( 01:38:52 ) Beautiful day, ooh.

Speaker 3 ( 01:39:08 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Robert Kennedy Jr.

Robert Kennedy Jr. ( 01:39:18 ):

Thank you. Thank you.

Audience ( 01:39:18 ):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Robert Kennedy Jr. ( 01:40:05 ):

Thank you very much, Michigan. Thank you. Thank you.

Audience ( 01:40:41 ):

Robbie, Robbie, Robbie, Robbie, Robbie.

Robert Kennedy Jr. ( 01:40:52 ):

All right. I've been on the road running for president for… Thank you. So I've been on the road running for president. First a Democrat, then as an independent, and now for President Trump. 19 months I've been to 48 states and all the polling when I was running as a Democrat and independent showed that I was taking more votes away from Donald Trump than from President Biden or Kamala Harris. President Trump never treated me uncivilly. He was always very kind and civil toward me and always very friendly, and he never litigated against me.

( 01:41:53 ) The Democratic Party started suing me almost on day one. They sued me to keep me off the ballot in 10 states. They spent $10 million. I spent $10 million trying to get on the ballot in place like Michigan. The day that I endorsed President Trump, the Democratic Party changed and began suing me to keep me on the ballot and it's election interference. They know I'm not running for president and they're just trying to confuse people. Oh, two days ago I lost a case in the United States Supreme Court about Michigan and Wisconsin and the DNC won that case, and they're forcing this state and Wisconsin to keep me on the ballot. When you go into the voting booth, I hope most of you have already. How many of you already voted? Yes.

( 01:43:08 ) When you go into that voting booth, you're going to see my name on the ballot. I do not want you to vote for me. If you want to see me go to Washington, you better vote for Donald Trump.

( 01:43:24 ) When I was 10 years old, my uncle was President of the United States. 6% of the people in this country, the children, had chronic disease, today 60% do. The autism rates have gone in one in 10,000. In my generation, 70-year-old men today, the autism rate is one in 10,000 and my children's generation is one in every 34 kids, according to the CDC. When I was a kid, the diabetes rate was zero for juvenile diabetes. A pediatrician typically would see one case of diabetes in a 40 or 50 year career. Today, one out of every three children who walks through his office door is diabetic and pre-diabetic.

( 01:44:23 ) I never heard of a peanut allergy when I was a kid. I never knew anybody who had… 11 siblings. I had 70 cousins, none of them had peanut allergies. Today there's kids with peanut allergies and food allergies and eczema in every classroom. All of these diseases we never heard before. Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ADD, ADHD, speech delay, language delay, tics, Tourette's syndrome, narcolepsy, ASD, autism, all of these that I never heard of as a kid, and they're now epidemic in our children.

( 01:44:57 ) When my uncle was president, we spent zero on chronic disease in this country, there weren't even any drugs for it. Today we spent $4.3 trillion. It is existential for our country and 77% of American kids cannot qualify for military service today because of chronic disease epidemic and obesity. The obesity rate when I was a kid was 3%. Today it's 50% of our kids. In other countries like Japan is still 3%. We have the sickest country in the world and this the sickest generation of kids. And if you elect Kamala Harris, you're going to get more of the same. We need to bring Donald Trump to Washington and make America healthy. I started working on this issue in 2005 and I was seeing kids… I know what a healthy kid's supposed to look like. I know what a child is supposed to look like, and our kids don't look like that anymore. They're so damaged today and all of you, how many of you know a kid with chronic disease? Raise your hand. Most of us know people with chronic disease and this is not normal. This is not what our children are supposed to be looking like. For 19 years, I pray every morning without a single exception that God would put me into position to end this chronic disease epidemic.

( 01:46:59 ) In August 23rd of this year, God sent me Donald J. Trump. And he told me I wanted you to help me end the addiction of our country to wars and bring that $200 billion we sent to the Ukraine to lose a war, bring it back home and rebuild America. And he said he wanted to end the censorship. He wanted to end the surveillance. He wanted to end the weaponization of American enforcement agencies against the American people and against our democracy. My Uncle Ted Kennedy wrote Title IX to make sure that women had opportunity to practice sports in school. Today's Democratic Party is destroying women's sports in school by letting men compete.

( 01:48:09 ) Donald Trump is going to protect women and he's going to protect women's sports. And he told me that he wants to end the chronic disease epidemic and make America healthy again. And don't you think and we deserve finally in this country a president who's going to end our addiction to foreign wars. And don't you think we deserve a president who's going to protect the Constitution and the Bill of rights and the freedom of speech and our freedoms here in America? And don't you want a president who's going to get the corruption out of the government and the corporate control and get the thousand ingredients that are in our food that are illegal in Europe? And don't you want a president who's going to make America healthy again? A president who's going to make America great again? Then let's get to the polls on Tuesday and elect Donald Trump in a landslide. Thank you very much.

MUSIC ( 01:49:50 ):

… got money on my mind.

( 01:49:50 ) I can never get enough.

( 01:49:50 ) Every I step up in the building, everybody hands go up.

( 01:49:56 ) And they stay there.

( 01:49:56 ) And they-

Donald Trump ( 01:52:42 ):

When I first came into office, I cut taxes more than any other president. We have created 7 million new jobs and it led to a growth like we've never seen before. We developed the greatest economy in history by far. When I left office, it changed. Inflation destroyed the lives of so many people. Interest rates went from 2% to 10%. Millions of illegal immigrants, traffickers, and drugs coming into our country. Our country has gone to hell. So I made a decision to run. We're going to make America great again, greater than ever before. I will fight for you with every breath, and I will never let you down.

MUSIC ( 01:53:34 ):

I'ma gonna fight like a jeep.

( 01:53:39 ) They all gon' see.

( 01:53:39 ) And if I die I'm gonna die free.

Speaker 4 ( 01:53:39 ):

President Trump is literally putting his life on the line and he's willing to risk it all because he loves this country.

Speaker 5 ( 01:53:46 ):

He is strong, he is fearless, and he is what this country needs right now.

Speaker 6 ( 01:53:53 ):

Our cities will be safe, our streets will be clean, and our border will be secure.

Speaker 7 ( 01:54:00 ):

We can't allow our country to be destroyed by politicians who will put their own power ahead of the interests of the American people, our freedom and our future.

Speaker 8 ( 01:54:09 ):

The left told me to hate Trump. When you cut through the lies, you realize the truth. American families were better when Donald Trump was president. We were safer, wealthier, and stronger.

Speaker 9 ( 01:54:20 ):

So if you love this country, if you want to stand up and fight for the future of our nation, you must re-elect Donald J. Trump.

Speaker 3 ( 01:54:41 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next President of the United States, President Donald J. Trump.

( 01:56:21 ) God bless the USA.

( 01:56:21 ) And I'm proud to be an American.

( 01:56:21 ) Where at least I know I'm free.

( 01:56:21 ) And I won't forget the men who died.

( 01:56:21 ) Who gave that right to me.

( 01:56:21 ) And I gladly stand up next to you.

( 01:56:21 ) And defend her still today.

( 01:56:57 ) Because there ain't no doubt. I love this land.

( 01:57:08 ) God bless the USA.

Donald Trump ( 01:57:16 ):

Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello. Hello everybody. Hello Michigan.

Audience ( 01:57:16 ):

USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.

Donald Trump ( 01:57:34 ):

Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Well, we're not going to have this too much longer. We're winding down. We're winding down. Nine years we've been doing it, right? And now we're winding down and hopefully we'll be going to the next phase, which is turning our country around. We've got a little bit of a mess to take care of, don't we? A little bit of a mess, but we'll get it done and we'll get it done right. But we're going to miss these rallies, aren't we? Huh? But there'll be even better rallies in a different form. I think we'll say that, right? Front row Joes, there'll be even better, but they'll be in a different form. And really the form that we want, that's what we've been striving for. We have to get out and vote, everybody. Don't take any chances because Kamala is never going to be able to do it.

( 01:58:29 ) She won't be able to do it. Not even a thought of doing it. Doesn't know how to do it. Doesn't even know how to say to do it. We cannot take any chances. So you got to get out to vote. And I can only say that it's been the experience of a lifetime for a lot of us. Some of you have been to 300 rallies. I see these people. And you're going to look back at this time in life and you're going to say, there was something very, very special about what we all did together. We all did it together. There's never been anything.

( 01:59:10 ) We'll have everything so good and fixed up and perfect. We'll have everything perfect. And then in four years, somebody will come down and that person's going to be hot as a pistol. And you know what? They're going to draw about 300 people. That's what you draw. A politician draws 250, 300 if they're good. If they're bad, they draw like eight people like Biden used to draw, right? Remember, he used to fill up… Remember the circles. Couldn't fill up the circle. So he used the fake news media to fill up the circles. But no, it's different. But they'll never be in the world there'll never be anything like what we've done. We've done something that's unprecedented and we've had fun. But now we have to get hopefully to work. We got to win. You got to get out and vote.

( 01:59:59 ) And then we're going to do a real job for you all. And we're going to meet again many times I hope. But this has been the thrill of a lifetime for me and for you and for everybody. And now we want to take that thrill and turn it into let's do business, right? Let's do business.

( 02:00:16 ) So it's great to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. And I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question. I've been doing that lately because it seems so poignant. Are you better off now than you were four years ago? I don't think so. I don't think so. Is that one of the easiest questions you've ever been asked? But I've come today with a message of hope for all Americans. With your vote this election, the most important election you've ever even thought about voting in, I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals pouring into our country, and I will bring back the American dream. Bring it back.

( 02:01:18 ) Yesterday, we had a long day. We started out before 7:00 in the morning, we went to New Mexico. It's sort of in play because the people can't take it anymore. The people are pouring through the border. That's a real border state. But you're a border state in a different sense. Everybody is a border… Every state is a border state. We have criminals coming in from… They fly them in now to the Midwest. Isn't that nice of them? Kamala, and you said, who the hell would want to do it? And so many of those people are hardened criminals coming out of prisons, jails, mental institutions. But this is all you need to know. Kamala, who's grossly incompetent, broke it. I will fix it. We're going to fix it. We're going to fix it quickly.

( 02:02:09 ) America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer, and stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we live and have four more years of gross incompetence and failure, or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country. We'll get it going fast. We're going to get it going very fast. And I'm asking you to be excited about the future of your country. Be excited. It's been hard to say, but now we're down to four days. Four days, right? Front row Joe. No. I mean if you think, we're down to four days, wow. We thought it would never come, right? We thought it would never come. I'm asking you to dream big again. You have to dream big. It's hard for you to think of that because you've been so hurt by these incompetent fools that have been running our country.

( 02:03:10 ) This will be America's new golden age. Every problem facing us can be solved and it's going to be solved quickly. But now the fate of our nation is in your hands and it really is. It's in… You got to vote. You got to vote. Don't believe the polls that were way up or were pretty far up, but a couple of them way up. One gentleman, a great pollster, they say, he said, "We have a 97% chance of winning." I said, "Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Don't believe it. Don't believe it." I think he's a Democrat because nothing matters except what happens on Tuesday when you think of it, right?

( 02:03:51 ) All doesn't matter. So just pretend that we're one point down. We're not. We're up. But pretend that we're one point down. On Tuesday, you have to stand up and you have to tell Kamala that you've had enough. You can't take it anymore. You're the worst vice president in history. You're the worst border czar in the history of the world. We're not going to let you destroy our country. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here. Thank you. She shouldn't even be in this fight. She shouldn't be. She doesn't deserve to. The guy got… Look, whether you like him or not, he got 14 million votes. He won the primaries. Then they walked in. They told him, "You're out." He had a debate, which was a little rough. And then he… No, but that's his prerogative. It just happens, right? And they walked in, they said, "You're out." And he said, "No, I'm not. I won't leave." They went, "You're out. Get the hell out. You're out." And they were not nice to him, by the way. I know exactly what went on. Don't forget. I know all those people that are in the surrounds very well. They were rough with Joe Biden. And think of it, he got 14 million votes and they're telling him get the hell out. And then they give it to her. And she came in last in the Democrat primary, right?

( 02:05:25 ) She came in last. She was 22 people, Mr. Ambassador? 22 people, think of it. 22 people. She was the first one to drop out. I guess that means she came in last. She never made it to the great state of Iowa during their primaries. And then we were running against her. It's actually not fair to him. It's really not fair to him. That's no way… He's got the right… Who cares? Who said that? That's our great line. Who the hell said that? That's… He goes, I'm going… I've become such a nice guy all of a sudden, I say it's not fair to him. And this guy shouts out, "Who cares? Who the hell cares? Who cares about him?" I guess he happens to be right. That's very good. Thank you for adding so much spice. That was a good line of stuff.

( 02:06:29 ) Who cares? But he did get screwed. Let's face it. No, they came in. They should have picked somebody else. They could have picked the one that came in first runner-up. You pick first. You know who that would be? Crooked Bernie, right? Crooked Bernie. Crooked Bernie Sanders. He got screwed twice. He got screwed with Hillary. I think he's one of the best sports because he got terribly taken advantage of with Hillary. And she won and he went back and he just kept being very liberal. By the way, he's far less liberal than Kamala. You know that, right? She's rated the worst, most liberal, crazy person in the US Senate. She's more so than even Pocahontas, who's very… Remember she said, my mother told I was an Indian. How do you know you're an Indian? Because my mother told me I have high cheekbones. You believe it?

( 02:07:26 ) I actually think that's a racist comment that she made. I think that's a racist comment. Everything we have been fighting for these past four years comes down to the next four days. Can you believe it, right? We've been setting records in the early voting, but we can't let up. In person voting in Michigan ends on Sunday. And if you're not going to make that, you got to get there on Tuesday. Okay. Who's voted?

( 02:07:59 ) So who's going to vote? All right, 60/40. That's not bad. That's a lot of votes. You got to get the hell out and vote because it's now or never. If we don't do it's never going to happen again. There are those that say that if we don't win this election, you may never have another election in this country again, that's a possibility with these radical left lunatics that we're dealing with. Crazy Nancy. You want to marry me? She wants to marry me. What the hell? But let me ask the first lady if that would be okay, because it's okay with me, but I have to get permission. Thank you. That's cute actually. So get everyone you know. Vote, vote, vote. Get everyone you know. There's a woman named Jane. I saw her backstage. She's got a husband who's not in good shape at all. And I asked her, "Are you going to vote?"

( 02:09:00 ) "Yes sir." And I asked the husband, "Are you going to vote?" "Well, I don't know. We have a game." A game. And he said, "No, this is the biggest game of all. This is a thousand times…" You know what we are doing is a thousand times bigger than the Super Bowl. It is. When the NFL has a problem, they had a big problem with Canada. Big problem. Canada was actually taking advantage of the NFL for years and they couldn't get it solved. You know what they did? They called the president and I got it solved in like two minutes. I got it solved in two minutes. This is a hundred times… They fought for 21 years with Canada. I got it solved in two minutes. They never even said thank you. They didn't say thank you. With your help, we're going to defeat Kamala Harris and we're going to make America great again. I'm studying my hair. It looks not so good today. It's not a good hair day, but who cares? Not a good hair day for me. I don't want to look. But we have breaking news. It's actually bad news. It's only good for one thing, if you happen to be running against the stupid fools that created this news. It's bad news, bad news for the country who just announced a little while ago that brand new jobs report, proves decisively that Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe have driven our economy off a cliff. And if she gets four more years, your family is never going to… You're never recover from these stupid people. We're being taken advantage of by every country all over the world, including our allies. And in many cases, our allies are worse than our so-called enemies on trade.

( 02:11:17 ) Nationwide, this just came out. Listen to this. You got to study these numbers. Does anybody have a pencil? Please take it down. Nationwide, the economy created, this is the lowest number in years, a pitiful 12,000 jobs last month. Whoa. Hundreds of thousands of jobs less than what it should be. I never heard of 12,000 jobs. That's not even believable. And when they revise it downward in a few weeks, it will be much lower than that. They'll have to revise it downward and just think… This is not good news for them. I mean, how would you like to have an election

Donald Trump ( 02:12:00 ):

… in four days and you just had the worst jobs report in the history of our country practically.

Audience ( 02:12:04 ):

[inaudible 02:12:12]

Donald Trump ( 02:12:14 ):

Now think of it, you're running for office, they announce … you know the best thing they have going? The fake news, because they won't even write about it. The fake news. The fake news won't even write about it.

( 02:12:32 ) By the way, how good was Bobby Kennedy Jr? How good was he? And he's so into health and all. He is going to take care of women's health, and men's health, and your children's health. I said, you could do anything. You just go ahead and enjoy yourself. But just do me one favor, leave the liquid gold alone. Let me handle that. We're going to make a fortune. Bobby, please leave that alone. Bobby, just let me handle that. Oh, we're going to make so much money.

( 02:13:17 ) But just think. A few months ago they fraudulently claimed … do you remember this? Two months ago. 818,000 jobs were created when in fact there were none. It was a fraud. It was a fraud. And people reported it to the FBI but the FBI decided to do nothing. Are you shocked to hear that? It was a total lie and they thought they'd be able to get away with it right through the election. But fortunately, there was a person known as a whistleblower. I knew I liked whistleblowers on occasion. And they were forced to admit it three weeks ago, that they created 818,000 fraudulent jobs. They were fake jobs. And everybody said, "Oh, the economy's finally coming back." No, no, it's not coming back. They were fake jobs. If I did that, they would impeach me. They would say, "Let's impeach him." But now they've just revised past jobs, okay, by an additional 118.

( 02:14:32 ) Now, they're just announced, yesterday, that they're going to have to reduce them again by 112,000 because they were fake jobs too. This administration is a big fat con job. The whole thing is dishonest. It's all misinformation and disinformation. That's almost a million fake jobs that never were here. And they wanted to wait … how would you feel if you said, "Well, our economy's okay." And then we vote and we have an election-

Audience ( 02:15:05 ):

Liar.

Donald Trump ( 02:15:05 ):

And let's say they win. I can't even imagine it. But let's say they win. And then two days later they announced that there were a million jobs that were phony. How would you like that John James? No, good, right? Huh? No good.

Audience ( 02:15:20 ):

[inaudible 02:15:23]

Donald Trump ( 02:15:22 ):

We got to do something about it. They never do anything about it. We never do. These are fraudulent people. No, but how would you like … the election's over, and we have this person that nobody ever … you hear, Harris. Harris. Who the hell is Harris? Nobody even knows who the hell she is. Who the hell is she? Nobody knows who the hell she is. Harris. Ladies and gentlemen, President Harris. Who the hell is Harris? It's true.

Audience ( 02:15:51 ):

Boo.

Donald Trump ( 02:15:56 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, Harris came in by announcing 1 million jobs more than existed. It's a fake. Like, two days after the election, you feel down, you lost an election, and how about the other side? The other side is saying, "Man, they said they had a great thing going. They just announced a million jobs more than they that. They didn't have a million jobs." These are terrible people. I'm telling you they're terrible people.

Audience ( 02:16:21 ):

[inaudible 02:16:24]

Donald Trump ( 02:16:24 ):

But let's bring it all together. We love everybody, right? No, we don't actually. How about her? She's always talking about, "I want to bring the country together. Trump is Hitler." Excuse me, I shouldn't have said that. No, she's always saying, "I want to go on peace, and we want to get together as a country, and the Trump people are garbage, total garbage. Oh. But we want to get together. And Trump is Hitler. And they're all racist. And they're all this. And they're all that. But we want to have peace, so we want to get along."

Audience ( 02:17:04 ):

Lies.

Donald Trump ( 02:17:05 ):

I don't even know if she knows what the hell she's saying, but it's pathetic. Kamala failed. Economic agenda wiped out nearly 30,000 private sector jobs just recently, and nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs just over the last short period of time. Did you know that? You lost 50,000 manufacturing jobs.

( 02:17:29 ) That's better with a mic. That's better. Thank you backstage. These mic guys. I'm telling you, I'm having a lot of problems with mics lately. I'm not happy. Get yourself a new contractor please. And don't pay the bill for this contractor. And then they'll write a story. Trump doesn't pay bills. I pay bills. You know what I do? I pay more than I'm supposed to when they can do a good job. But when they don't do a good job, don't pay your damn bill. That's my first … Man. I got to do these speeches like three, four times a day for 62 days almost. And then on top of it, I have a mic that doesn't work half the time. All right.

( 02:18:17 ) Our manufacturing sector is now in very severe recession. Almost a 100,000 manufacturing jobs are killed since the start of the year. Think of that. Think of that, 100,000. That's a lot of jobs. Especially when you add on the fraudulent almost a million jobs, right? So that's 1.1 million. 150,000 Americans joined the unemployment rolls last month. Do you know that? You don't hear that from these fake news people, because they don't report it. They don't report it. They don't report it just like they don't show how many people are in this room because they don't do it. Just like they don't show the videos.

( 02:19:01 ) A friend of mine … you know we do videos now. We made a little money. We bought some things for a million bucks. Can you believe it? I spent a million dollars for some screens so you people could see better. Think of it. Think of it. And you know the problem? I get a friend … I have a friend, he's watching. A number of people called me. They said, "We loved your rally last night it's too bad we couldn't see the videos." What do you mean you couldn't see the videos? He said, "They don't put them on." I said, "Of course they do." But they don't. You know why? Because they're told not to. And they're told not to show the crowd size where you go from room to room, from place to place. We never have an empty seat and nobody leaves early. But you know what? We never have an empty seat.

( 02:19:43 ) But I said, I want to have them show. Oh, we have it out with them all the time. A friend of mine said they don't show the thing. And think of the cameras, right? All they have to do … It's right there. There's the screen. There's the screen. All they have to do is one inch right. Ding. One inch up. Ding. And they can see it. But they don't want to do that. Because they don't want to show because they're fake news. That's why they're fake news.

Audience ( 02:20:25 ):

[inaudible 02:20:28]

Donald Trump ( 02:20:28 ):

And most importantly, nearly 250, 000 people dropped out of the labor force last month. Can you believe this? We're in a depression. You better hope you vote for me because I'm going to get you out of it fast. But under these losers it's only going to get worse. This would only get worse. This will only get worse. You're not going to have a country left, honestly, if you don't vote for Trump. You're not going to have a country left. Under Kamala's nation-wrecking policies the American worker is absolutely drowning. You're drowning. You're not going to have your job very soon.

Audience ( 02:21:09 ):

[inaudible 02:21:09]

Donald Trump ( 02:21:09 ):

And that stupid fool at United Auto Workers, that poor stupid fool that runs the union, he said, "Yes, we'll go." He agreed to all electric cars. And I said they wouldn't work five months ago. And you know what? Now they don't work. Look, electric cars are great, but for a certain percentage of people. Okay? You don't force it on everybody. Nor do you say, everybody has to have a hybrid, which are also great. Or an all-gasoline-powered car.

( 02:21:45 ) The only thing we don't want is a hydrogen car. Because hydrogen … somebody said, "Well, they don't work. But very seldom, sir." I said, "What is seldom?" "Well, once every two or three weeks." "Well, what happens if it doesn't work?" "Sir, the person is unrecognizable. The person in the car or people in the car or absolutely unrecognizable. It's like a major bomb went off, but we're working on the problem." I said, "I have no interest in hydrogen." Whoever the hell's working on hydrogen, we don't want a hydrogen car. Can you imagine? You call the wife, there's your husband [inaudible 02:22:25] the tree. I don't see him. The tree's bright red. I don't see him. The data shows that 100% of all net job gains …Listen to this. Think of it. It's all gone to the migrants … Along with African-American jobs are at the worst one of the worst levels.

Audience ( 02:22:45 ):

[inaudible 02:22:47]

Donald Trump ( 02:22:46 ):

They're all going to migrants. The African-American. When you see those numbers, that's the numbers the fake news ought to show you because they're going to come out with numbers right after the elections. It's going to show that all those people that illegally come across the border with their open-border policy are taking the African-American jobs away.

Audience ( 02:23:05 ):

Boo. [inaudible 02:23:08] No.

Donald Trump ( 02:23:12 ):

Now, can you imagine? Guys have jobs for 20 years. They've got a family. They have everything. They're doing a good job. They're good people, good workers, and their jobs are being taken away by people that just came in. And it's not right. Hispanic jobs also, to a lesser extent, union jobs will be affected. Not yet, but they will be very much so. But the African-American jobs … you ought to tell them to go get you the real numbers. Because when you see this, it's going to be probably after the election, you're going to be really angry. You're going to say, "You know I wish I voted for Trump. He got me criminal justice reform. He got me the colleges." Historically black colleges and universities. I took care of them. I took care of them. I took care of them.

( 02:24:06 ) Every year they'd come to Washington, the heads of … Nice guys, a lot of nice people, actually. After two years, I said, "Why do you guys keep coming to Washington?" These were the heads of the black colleges and very important group of schools actually, and great people that I got to really like some of them. Some of them became friends of mine. And in the third year I said, "You're here again. Why are you here?" I never asked them the first two times. "Because they make us come back every year for money because they have funding." And I said, "Why don't they give you a long-term deal?" He said, "They would never do it." I said, "I'm going to do it. I'm going to give you a long-term deal for more money than you're asking because you're not asking for enough." And I got them taken care of. And I said, "The only bad thing about what I'm doing is I'll never see you again. Most likely I'll never see you again. Which is sad. But you know what? It's wrong what they're doing to you." They had to come back for years and years. They came back every year hat in hand. One guy said, "They make us like beggars. Like beggars." These are black wonderful people that run the universities.

Audience ( 02:25:18 ):

[inaudible 02:25:20]

Donald Trump ( 02:25:20 ):

They run the universities. You're right? So I took care of that. I took care of so many things. But remember the criminal justice reform, I was called by some people at CNN that I'm the only one that can get it done because I can bring some conservative votes over. And I did do that and I got criminal justice reform done. And it was really, the black population wanted it more than anybody else because it was very unfair what was happening. And we got it done. And I'll tell you, and I made this statement, with the exception of who? Abraham Lincoln. I did more as president for the black population than any other president in the history of our country.

( 02:26:16 ) But now the migrants are going to take those jobs that you have and you should demand before the election that you see because you'll never vote for her Kamala. You'll never vote for her. She doesn't know what the hell she's doing. Kamala's inflation nightmare has cost a typical American family $30,000 in higher prices, and she's continuing to cost you an additional $1,100 for every single month. That's because of what they've done with inflation. I had no inflation. We had no inflation. We had no inflation. We went from essentially no inflation to the highest inflation in the history of our country. And then they say they're going to vote for these fools. They're going to vote for these fools. Remember, I had virtually no inflation. You had no problem. You were making money. You were putting money away. You had money left over. You could go out shopping and your prices weren't quadrupled for a sausage, for a piece of lettuce, for an apple.

Audience ( 02:27:26 ):

Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 02:27:26 ):

Now the prices have gone so high. Everyone tells me about the word groceries for groceries. Cars. Look at the price of cars. Look at the price of education. These schools have … I mean, they're going crazy with the education prices. They're going absolutely crazy, but I had no inflation. I had prices stable. We wouldn't put up with it. We would talk to people too if they were ripping you off. We would talk to people. We had smart people, the best people. And now look at what happened. The inflation is eating everybody alive. It's eating every … especially our senior citizens.

Audience ( 02:28:03 ):

[inaudible 02:28:05]

Donald Trump ( 02:28:04 ):

That's why I do no tax on social security benefits because it gets you back to even. But now that very low-IQ person who wants to be … Have we ever had a low-IQ president before?

Audience ( 02:28:21 ):

[inaudible 02:28:26]

Donald Trump ( 02:28:25 ):

You have to know the opposition. You have to know, President Xi, the press hates when I say it. I say very smart. If I use the word brilliant, they'll say, "He said, he's brilliant." "No, he controls 1.4 billion people with an iron fist. No he's not brilliant." But these are very smart people. These are brilliant people. These are people that, like their country … maybe they don't, but they run their country tough and smart, and we have nobody to compete with them. We have people that … It's like your high school football team playing. What's a good team today? Let's see, what's a good term? What's a good team?

Audience ( 02:28:59 ):

[inaudible 02:29:04]

Donald Trump ( 02:29:04 ):

Oh, the Detroit Lions, right?

Audience ( 02:29:06 ):

Yeah.

Donald Trump ( 02:29:12 ):

I couldn't have said that two years ago. Good. I got bailed out. I'm trying to say what the hell. The worst thing you can do is mention some team that's not from the area. And I'm saying, "Oh shit, I'm in Michigan. What the hell am I going to … I'm stuck up here." See, John? She wouldn't be able to figure that out. She couldn't even get off the stage when she said, we have 32 days left. Remember? The teleprompter froze and she couldn't get off the stage? No. It's like your high school team playing the Detroit Lions. That's right. That's a pretty good team. They did a good job after so many years, right? They did a good job. See, that's what good management is. You get the right people. It's the same thing in government. You get the right people and good things happen.

( 02:29:57 ) But now Kamala wants to impose the largest tax hike in American history and raise your taxes by at least $3,000 a year.

Audience ( 02:30:06 ):

No. Boo.

Donald Trump ( 02:30:10 ):

It's much worse than that actually, because she wants to terminate the tax cuts that you've gotten. I stand before you today as the only candidate who can … I mean, we're going to rescue this thing. We're going to be able to do it, and it's going to happen fast. It's going to be rescued. Your prices are going down. We are going to drill, baby drill. We're going to bring prices down. Who can rescue our economy from total obliteration and restore our country to full prosperity, explosive growth, and maximum strength. It is about growth. It's about growth. It's about some proper cost-cutting. You know who we're going to use for that? Elon. He thinks he can find two trillion dollars. Only Elon. Anybody that can have that rocket come down the way it came down that sucker. Right? How about that? How cool was that? He's the only one that can do it.

( 02:31:08 ) Cutting two trillion, finding two trillion is easy. When you can do when you can do that … and he wants to do it. You know where he is right now? He's campaigning in Pennsylvania for Donald Trump. How cool is that, right? How cool. No, he's cool. He wore that black hat. Remember the black hat? He called it Dark MAGA. Dark MAGA. You'd look good in that hat. He called it Dark MAGA. He looked cool. You know what happened? I don't think we sold one dark hat in two years. I didn't even know we had them, you want to know the truth. And everything's subtle where it says, "Make America great again." It was also in black. So he had black on black. That's called very subtle. And he wore it and he loved it, and he did great. He made a speech, did great. We had 107,000 people in Butler, PA, right? Honoring the firefighter, Corey. Honoring Corey the firefighter. 107. And Elon got up and made his speech and he did a good speech. He said, "I've never seen so many people. I've never seen anything like it."

( 02:32:18 ) Then because he comes sort of out of a laboratory. You know what he likes, that's how he feels comfortable. All of a sudden he's on the stage. He's got all those people and he's wearing the hat. I said, "What is it?" He said, "Dark MAGA." I said, "Listen, that hat looks great, Elon." Okay, so I sold two hats in the last year. Dark MAGA Nobody bought them. We had a run on the hats. They sold 71,000 black hats. Can you believe it? 71,000. You make money with money. Wait. It's a hot item.

( 02:32:55 ) Anyway, it has just released numbers plainly indicate our economy is a total disaster and is expected to get very substantially worse. It's a wonderful time for me to come in. This is what I want. No, I would've rather come in when things are going in the right direction, but we're going to get it straightened out fast. We'll have the best economy you've ever had. The stock market's going up. Scott Bessent, some of the smartest analysts on Wall Street said it's only going up for one reason, because Trump's leading in the polls and everyone thinks Trump's going to be president. They think Trump's going to win the election. That's why it's going up. Now, here's the bad news. They say if he doesn't win, you end up in a depression.

( 02:33:43 ) Wait till you see that? It'll be a 1929-style economic depression that will absolutely crush your incomes and all that stuff.

Audience ( 02:33:51 ):

We need you.

Donald Trump ( 02:33:52 ):

But we're not going to talk about that because we want to make sure we win. And when we win, you are four days away from the best jobs, the biggest paycheck, and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen. You're going to be great. You'll love it. And we will end Kamala's economic disaster and launch a brand new Trump economic miracle. Steve Moore, a great economist. He's great actually. He is a great guy, right? He is a great guy. He just wrote called, The Trump Economic Miracle. It just came out. It's a bestseller. Go buy it. It's great. It's a great book. I mean, what the hell? It's like 20 bucks.

Audience ( 02:34:35 ):

[inaudible 02:34:37]

Donald Trump ( 02:34:37 ):

It's 20 bucks. Give the guy 20 bucks. No, it's a great book. It's a hot book. The Trump Economic Miracle by Steve Moore. Go buy it. It's great. He really tells us how we did it and what we're going to do. It's not that complicated. I will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses and we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security benefits for our great seniors.

( 02:35:06 ) And they're going to claim Donald Trump has a conflict of interest because I'm a senior and I'm giving … They're going to say, "He only did it because he didn't want to pay tax." Oh, they'll come up with something. They'll say there's some reason that he did it. No, I think the fixed-income seniors, which is 96%. You? You don't look like a senior to me, let me tell you. You look like a good senior. I don't feel like a senior. Does anybody feel like a senior? I don't feel … I feel better now. I think I'm sharper and better now than I was 25, 30 years ago. I do. I swear. I'll let you know when I don't. In fact, you'll probably know before me. All you have to do is watch. There'll be a day when you get up here, you'll say, "Where am I?" Like Joe did, right? "Where am I? Where are the stairs? Where the hell are the stairs? Oh, there they are."

( 02:36:08 ) You'll know. I think I'll know before you actually. I think I will. But I think we have a long way to go. Good parents. It's nice to have parents that lived a long time. Because if you believe in that … I do. I believe in that. It's called genetics. Genetics is good. Not everything, but it sure as hell is good. It is better to have good genetics than bad genetics. And I will support a tax credit for family caregivers who are amazing people who take care of a parent or a loved one. And if we didn't have family caregivers, we wouldn't have enough hospitals. If we doubled our capacity, we wouldn't have enough. These people do so much and we're going to get them a tax credit. To rapidly reduce inflation I will end Kamala's war on American energy and we will drill baby drill.

Audience ( 02:36:59 ):

Drill baby drill.

Donald Trump ( 02:37:00 ):

Thank you. And I'll cut your energy prices in half within 12 months. We're going to cut your energy prices and that's going to be the beginning, and we're going to bring your cost of groceries, foods, everything. We're going to all come down. That's what caused the problem. The energy is what caused it, because they came in and they destroyed what I had built. What a stupid group of people. All he had to do is go to the beach. He went to the beach all the time, right? Somebody said he looks great. He's 82 years old. He looks unbelievable in a bathing suit. But he went to the beach and he had a hard time moving. You know those things, they weigh like about six ounces, they're hollowed aluminum, they're so light. They're meant for children and very old people. And what happens is he couldn't move it. He needed people to help him. So a kid came along who was five years old and helped. But he went to the beach and he had one quality that I don't have, and I wish I could have it. I'd pay a lot for it. He has the ability to fall asleep instantly with cameras on. Who the hell could do that? And you see him falling asleep and drooling out the right side of his mouth and he's gone. And he gets a good rest.

( 02:38:21 ) I don't do that. I toss and turn and turn and toss. I'm thinking about how the hell I'm going to make money for you people. Tossing and turning. Always tossing and turning, spinning around like a top. How the hell … Thinking about China, thinking about Russia. The Russia hoax. How about the Russia hoax? That was another deal. I will cut a record number of job-killing regulations. I will terminate the green new scam, the biggest scam, the greatest scam in the history of our country. And I will end Kamala's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving the Michigan auto industry from extinction.

( 02:39:09 ) And I was here four weeks ago. I was at the Detroit Economic Club, and we had a meeting and it was about automobiles, cars and stuff, because you're getting killed. Look, you just lost 40,000-50,000 jobs. This guy, the head of the union, I'm leading by far in the popular poll in the rank and file with the union.

Audience ( 02:39:27 ):

[inaudible 02:39:29]

Donald Trump ( 02:39:29 ):

But they have guys that only go for Democrats. That's all right. Shawn Fain or whatever the hell his name is. So listen, and I told the story about a year ago, I have a friend that builds auto plants. Has anyone heard this story?

Audience ( 02:39:42 ):

Yeah. Yeah.

Donald Trump ( 02:39:43 ):

Should I tell it again?

Audience ( 02:39:44 ):

Yeah.

Donald Trump ( 02:39:45 ):

Should I? John? Oh, there he is, my man. Come on up here. Get up here. This guy is so great. This guy. Come on up. Secret Service may rough you up a little bit.

( 02:39:59 ) Come on up here. This guy gets it. He got it. Yeah, look at him. Look at him. Look at the arms on him. Look at the arms. All I can say is I'm taller than him, but he has much bigger arms, much bigger. And he's a great guy and he loves this whole … I think you just love Detroit. You love the area. But I've been telling you for a year and a half about this incident that I had. A friend of mine, John, he builds plants. That's all he does. He's a rich guy. He builds plants. If you told him to build an apartment, he wouldn't know how. If you told him to put down asphalt, he would. But he could build a plant like nobody. He builds all of them, most of them. And he was telling me that he's building some big plants.

( 02:40:54 ) I said, "I want to see one. Let's go." I want to see a plant under construction. I like that. I basically, I like that stuff. I was always good at it too. Always a good builder. I always built great buildings. So I wanted to see one. He said, "We'll have to go to Mexico." We know the story. We're going to have to go to Mexico because all of the big plants. I said, "What do you mean Mexico? What about here?" No. This is a year ago. I said, "Really, let me see." And he showed me a plant. That's the biggest plant I think in the world. It would ruin Detroit. It does probably more than all of your plants put together. It's massive. Owned by China. So China was going to come in and build one of the biggest plants in the world, I think the biggest plant by far actually in the world. And some others. Right along our border. Make cars, put them into here. And you can forget about Detroit, you can forget about Michigan. It would be over.

( 02:41:47 ) And I didn't like it. So he told me about it a year ago. And then I started thinking about it and I said, "If they build that plant …" And they're decimating Europe what they're doing. They're dumping cars in there like crazy. And it's being decimated. The auto industry. The manufacturing of car industry. So what happened is he said, "No, this is the way it is. It's going to happen." I said, "We're not going to let that happen." Because if they build these massive plants, especially this one monster plant, it's so big that you wouldn't believe it. So I announced when I was at the Detroit Economic Forum, and a little before that, that I'm going to put 100% tariffs, and if that's not high enough, I'll make it 200%.

Speaker 10 ( 02:42:32 ):

Yeah. Yeah.

Donald Trump ( 02:42:36 ):

And I announced it a little before the forum actually. And I said, "No, we're going to put 100% and maybe I'll make a 200%, maybe I'll make it 300%, 400%. I don't give a damn. I'll make it whatever I have to make it. And that was it. I just made the announcement. I didn't make a big deal out of it. The fake news didn't pick it up because they don't want to pick it up, but I didn't want to see Detroit destroyed and other places like South Carolina and Tennessee and a lot of other places. But your state more than any other state without question. And so what happened is I forgot about it. Now I'm speaking and I see this guy, John, the builder of auto plants, and I said, "I'd like to see him after I speak."

( 02:43:15 ) So I speak, I'd made my speech. It was a brilliant speech. Brilliant. And I saw him. I saw him, and I said, "John, how's that plant going that you're building in Mexico on the border?" He said, "Sir, they've canceled that plant last week. They're not going to build it because they think you are going to win and they think you're going to put tariffs on the cars and therefore they're not going to be able to bring any cars into the United States. And they said, if Trump wins, this thing is not going to work at all." But I'll tell you what, that plant will go up so fast if there's a mishap. Here's the good news. There's only one way. There can be a mishap. And you know what that way is. And I hope to hell that doesn't happen. I hope to hell that doesn't happen again.

Speaker 10 ( 02:44:02 ):

[inaudible 02:44:04]

Donald Trump ( 02:44:03 ):

I'm just proud of this guy because he's been on my … I didn't know who the hell he is.

Speaker 10 ( 02:44:07 ):

I got your back.

Donald Trump ( 02:44:08 ):

I didn't know who he was. All I know is he has very good, strong arms. I'm impressed by his arms. He's a strong guy. But he was a good guy and a smart guy. And he was against the electric cars because he said they're going to be made in China. You're going to get two good years, and after that, nobody's going to work. Did you see 37,000 auto jobs were cut this month? 37,000.

Speaker 10 ( 02:44:32 ):

I got more news for you.

Donald Trump ( 02:44:36 ):

Oh, you can tell them. Okay, you tell them. So here's the story. They're not building the plant. We're going to build those plants here.

Speaker 10 ( 02:44:48 ):

Yeah. Thanks to President Trump. Thank you, sir.

( 02:44:48 ) Okay, guys, listen, President Trump is telling you the truth about when we met, and it was a year and a half or so ago, and he asked me questions. He said, "How does your

Brian Pannebecker ( 02:45:00 ):

Industry like these EV mandates. And I said, "Sir, they don't like them. Nobody wants to buy those." We're not only auto workers, we're consumers too, right? We don't want to drive those things. How do you pull a trailer with four snowmobiles on it up to Traverse City when it's five degrees below zero in an EV? You can't do it. But Kamala Harris thinks she knows better than the experts in Detroit. She wants no more internal combustion engines produced by 2035 because she's smarter than the engineers at General Motors, right? President Trump gets it. Every time we met, we started talking backstage and he would ask me questions, I'd give him feedback. We talked back and forth and it became a regular thing. I got in the habit of coming up here and giving him updates on how things are going in the auto industry. I was holding a rally every week outside of a different auto plant in the Detroit area with a lot of these guys behind me, and we were talking to auto workers all summer long for four or five months. And I would ask them, I'd do my own poll, "What's it like inside? Are they voting for Trump? How's our support?" I'd say, "Do we have majority in there?" They'd say "Majority? You got 65 or 70%. We're not voting for Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris." Don't believe anything you read in the newspaper. Don't believe anything you see Sean Fain talking about. The auto workers, UAW members are voting for Donald Trump for president.

( 02:46:45 ) Okay. That's the good news. That's the good news. But now I got some bad news for you, and this is going to really tick you off and motivate you to get your friends out to vote. Yesterday, Ford Motor Company sent out notices to all their workers at the Dearborn Ford pickup truck, the Lightning 100% electric vehicle. They laid everybody off till next year. All right? Those people through the holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years are unemployed. We don't know when they're coming back, but it won't be at least until next year. I don't know if you saw that news. Now I got some other news that the people in the back there don't like to talk about, but I'm going to pass it on. Now, this is big news. Because I've been getting called up on stage and I talk to President Trump on a regular basis, three vice presidents at Stellantis reached out to me through a friend of mine who's tied in with the auto industry.

( 02:48:01 ) And they wanted to give President Trump some bad news about what Stellantis has planned for next year, but they would only do it on the condition of 100% complete anonymity because they would be fired and lose their jobs if it came out that they had leaked this information because they had signed non-disclosure agreements. Now, these are not people on the assembly line. These are not high-low drivers like I was. The one gentleman, the lead of these three, is a vice president of manufacturing. Now, he recently retired, but they told me and they sent me all the data and information to back it up, and I've gotten it to the proper people that can vet it, check it out, corroborate it, and make sure it's all legit and accurate. But they told me that the expansions, "expansions" to the plants in Mexico that Stellantis is currently working on to handle additional capacity, those are going to be the only capacity when they get up and running because they're going to move all the American production south of the border to Mexico.

( 02:49:19 ) Now remember, Stellantis is not an American company. Chrysler's been used and abused like a stepchild. They were bought by Mercedes. They were bought by Fiat. Now they're owned by a French company. They don't care about you. They don't care about our jobs. You've heard all the speakers up here today. Every job in the Detroit area relies on the auto industry, but a French company that owns Chrysler is about to send all the Chrysler production to Mexico. There's only one way to stop this. There's only one person who will stop it. His name is Donald J. Trump.

( 02:50:12 ) I'm asking you, when you leave here today, you got two days, Saturday and Sunday, to get every single person in your contact list out to vote. Not Tuesday. Get them to vote tomorrow and Sunday. Okay? Tell them do not wait till Tuesday. They got to do it over the weekend, one phone call and they'll know where they got to go, but you got to get them out. And then when they vote, then they can get everybody on their contact list out to vote. We got to make it too big to rig. Let's elect Donald J. Trump the 47th President of the United States. [inaudible 02:51:01]. We're going to win.

Crowd ( 02:51:01 ):

Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump.

Donald Trump ( 02:51:09 ):

He's a hell of a guy. That guy. Thank you. He's something. He loves the country. He loves your state. Tell Stellantis, I think I'll send him back. He's quite good at delivering a message. Tell Stellantis that if they plan on moving, we're going to charge them a 100% tariff on every car they put out and they won't move. You know who said they're going to move? A company, I buy a lot of stuff from them, a lot. Great company. John Deere, going to move big sections of their company from Iowa, I believe they said to Mexico, and I told them, and I did it in writing. I said that if you do it, beware because I'm going to charge you about a 100% tariff on everything you make to put back. If you're going to move from Iowa and if you're going to move from Iowa to Mexico and then you think you're going to make it in Mexico and sell it over here and sell it at that cost, not going to happen.

( 02:52:06 ) We're going to do a 100% tariff. They announced, I believe that they're no longer making the move, didn't they? I think that's what I heard. Somebody told me the other day that they announced that they're not making the move. Why would they make the move? It'll cost them much more to make the product over there when we do this. In other words, we're going to use… Look, the most beautiful word in the dictionary to me is tariff. I think it's the most beautiful word. It's going to make our country rich and these stupid people… Look, politicians, there's only two reasons why they wouldn't want to use tariffs. They're stupid or they're corrupt. There's no third reason. They're either stupid or they're corrupt. I just stopped the largest plant in the entire world, which would destroy your state. I think this plant made more than all of Detroit put together.

( 02:52:59 ) It's a big, and I just stopped it and I'm not even president yet, okay? Think of what I could do when I'm president, but I have to find out. But I'm telling you, I told John Deere, we told them very strongly. We said, look, you're going to move out of Iowa? We're putting about a 100% tariff on anything you make. It was a different plant, it was parts and this and that. I said, you're going to do that. We're putting in a tariff. And that was it. I went on to other things like how to get elected very easily. And I heard two days ago that they're not going to build the plants here. It's pretty good, right? It's pretty good, but you're a hell of a guy. I'll tell you, he's a friend of mine.

( 02:53:46 ) I'll make interest on Carlin. Here's a thing I thought of, and it's funny, it's not that complicated. It's going to do tremendous good for your area because here's what I'm doing, I thought of this idea and then I expanded. A lot of times you have an idea and then you expand. I was always good financially and I was always very good on construction. In this case, construction doesn't matter. It's finance that matters. And people call me up, it doesn't sound complicated. From Wall Street, 182 IQ guys, brilliant guys. Where the hell did you ever come up with that idea? As an example, no tax on tips. I did that, everyone went crazy. Nobody ever heard of it before, right? [inaudible 02:54:28].

( 02:54:27 ) And then that dumb woman, very dumb woman, that low IQ individual two months later stood up. Today, I'd like to announce that we're not going to have tax on tips. And she got booed out of the place. It didn't work. You'd never heard a second… Nobody talked about it after that 'cause she was… One problem with what I do is I do it and then somebody else copies you, but they don't have the brainpower to get it done. I had this idea, but then I had a better idea using the first idea, but it's all pretty simple. I'm going to make interest on car loans fully tax-deductible. That's it, right?

( 02:55:10 ) And people said, where the hell did you have a… Isn't it funny? It's like the paperclip. Years ago, long before you youngster, years ago, somebody came up with the idea of the paperclip, I think 129 years ago, a long time ago. And he had a little piece of steel, metal, whatever. He bent it around, start selling it, and everybody saw it and they said, why the hell didn't I come up with that idea, right? The paperclip. But this is like that. That's fully deductible. That's going to be unbelievable, but here's the problem. I don't give a damn if they buy a car in Japan or China or South Korea, what the hell good does that do for us? Then I came up with phase two of the same idea, fully tax-deductible, but only if the car is made in the US. And I announced it last week up here.

( 02:56:11 ) I've been up here a lot 'cause we have to win Michigan. We win Michigan, we win Michigan. We win the whole ball of wax because… And we got to bring John James and all of these great guys with us. We got to bring them with us. But I got calls. Here it is, number one, the deductibility. They said, wow, what a great idea. But then number two, you only get it if you make the car in the US. I can't say here, but we'll try steering them to here because I would love… They've been talking about a renaissance and a rebirth for Detroit for 45 years. And I got into some heat because I said they've been talking about it for 45 years. And if it's okay with you, it hasn't exactly happened. Okay? I'd like to say it did, but it hasn't. And if I did, you'd hit me on that one too.

( 02:57:03 ) But it can happen, and I'd love to steer it right over to here where it all began because it's very sad. It's very sad what's happened. But think of it, you're going to have deductibility of interest. That's a big deal. You're going to be roaring, but I didn't want it to go to China, Japan, South Korea or any one of 10 other countries. I came up with phase two and I said, but only if the car is built in the United States of America, otherwise you don't get it. How good is that? You know what? That in itself will spur. I mean, you'll be spurred on… To bring back millions of jobs, we will give our companies the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burdens, and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet. Remember this, you're not going to have a best and biggest market soon. Your market's getting evaporated by incompetent people that are leading it. One guy who has to go to bed at 4:00 in the evening and another woman who's actually not nearly as smart as he is, would you believe this? But only for those who make their product the same thing. This is on a bigger scale than the autos. You can build your plant here and we love you, but if you don't build your plant here, you don't get the tariff, you don't get the tax cut, you don't get it. You have to build your plant. And these guys at Wall Street that are very brilliant guys, they call me up and says, who the hell gave you these ideas? And yet it's just like, I always say it's like the paperclip. People don't think about it, but think of the idea, that deductibility, that's that's going to make it great. Vote for Trump and you will see a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs from Mexico to Michigan, from Shanghai to Stirling Heights, and from Beijing to Detroit. Finally, Detroit will benefit, right? And it's easy.

( 02:59:05 ) And you know what her economic plan is? She doesn't have one. She doesn't have one. She wants to tax companies. You know what happens when you tax them? They leave. A lot of these big companies, they live in Switzerland. They have very glamorous lives. They have the life that I could have had if I decided not to do this. Actually, somebody said to me, are you glad you did it? I said, "Absolutely. But I could have been on the best beaches in the world." I owned the best beaches in the world. I could have had such… I could have been at the great Turnberry in Scotland. I could have been anywhere I wanted to be. I could have had those waves smacking me in the face. I could have said, that beautiful white skin that I have would be nice and tan.

( 02:59:51 ) I got the whitest skin 'cause I never have time to go out in the sun, but I have that beautiful white, and you know what? It could have been beautiful, tan, beautiful. But you know what? If I had the choice, I wouldn't even think about it. I would do exactly what I've done because we're going to make America great again. We're going to make America great again, greater than ever before. It's true. We're going to pass the Trump Reciprocal Trade Act also, that moves very simple. Reciprocal trade. Meaning if China or any other, I don't want to pick on China because the European Union is almost as bad as China. They don't accept your cars. They don't accept your farm products, but they send their farm products here and they send their cars here by the millions and millions. If China or any other country charges 100 to 200% tax, then we will charge them 100 or 200% tax in return. It's called an eye for an eye, and it'll all stop. I will never apologize for defending America. I will protect our workers. I will protect our jobs. I will protect our borders. I will protect our families, and I will protect the birthright of our children to live in the richest and most powerful nation on the face of the earth again.

( 03:01:14 ) And as we rescue our economy, I will also restore our borders because I think it's your biggest problem. I think inflation is terrible. It's a country buster. The economy is horrible. You saw the numbers, and I hope the fake news is going to write those numbers. There's a lot of fake news back there, but you'll be lucky if one guy writes it'll be the local Detroit newspaper or something. They don't write those numbers because they want to try and get her elected. Why? I don't know. That's the biggest thing I can't understand. Why the hell would you want her? She's horrible. But over the past four years, Kamala has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon its people. She has violated her oath and eradicated our sovereign border, totally eradicated our border and unleashed an army of gangs and criminal migrants from prisons and jails, insane asylums and mental institutions from all over the world, from Venezuela to the Congo in Africa. Congo, a lot of people coming in from the Congo and you know where they live in the Congo? In jails.

( 03:02:23 ) They're emptying their jails into this country, but they're doing it all over the world. In Asia, in the Middle East and in South America. Venezuela has released big portions of their jails into the United States, and I'm surprised they haven't done more yet. They will. It's going to all come in. You'll have 1100%, but I would've done it faster than them. I would've done it if I were them. Why would I keep these prisoners for 60 years, the killers and murderers and drug dealers and everything else, they've released them all into the United States. And you know what? Their crime has gone down by 72%. They've gotten their crime. They've gone into their cities, Caracas and cities, and they've taken the gangs and they've removed their gangs and they've put them into your country. Can you imagine? And this woman and this guy, but she was in charge of the border.

( 03:03:17 ) Remember, she was in charge of the border. He put her in charge of the border. She is the border czar. She doesn't want to say that because it's been so bad. And by the way, the Border Patrol endorsed me a few days ago with the strongest endorsement they've ever made. They actually said, I'm the greatest president in the history of our country. I said, "Are you talking about the border?" They said, "No, the border too. You're the best we ever had in the border, but you're the best president in the history of our country." And then I said, "Does that include Abraham Lincoln, George Washington? Does that include everybody? How about Lincoln, Washington?" We had some pretty good ones. We had some pretty bad ones too. A couple that we just had. Here's the good thing. Jimmy Carter has just turned a hundred. He's going to be a happy man. He's so thrilled because his administration looks totally brilliant compared to the Biden Kamala administration. Jimmy is a happy man today. He's led a brilliant administration by comparison.

( 03:04:26 ) Today I want to hear, and I want you to hear from a mother I just met two days ago who suffered gravely because her daughter was killed by an illegal migrant that would've never come in under the Trump policy. And she said that, would've never come in. We have open borders. These killers are coming in at levels that nobody's ever seen. Please watch.

Speaker 11 ( 03:04:52 ):

Sunday night, I asked her to not stay up super late because of her coming to work with me in the morning, first to do her summer school. She said, okay. I told her good night and I love you. I went to bed, not realizing that that was going to be the last time I saw her. We're best friend.

( 03:05:17 ) Yeah.

( 03:05:17 ) We go shake it again. I woke up to notice she wasn't in her bed. I am in my heart trying not to lose my mind because I don't know where she is. I finally remembered her phone had a location on and her phone was pinging just two minutes down the road, right behind the skate park. I start driving to the direction the phone was being pinged at, and I see a couple cop cars lights on. I see yellow tape, and immediately my heart drops and sinks to the bottom of my stomach. My daughter's hands and ankles were both bound. She was strangled to death and left with no pants. And I know in my heart she fought incredibly hard. She was not going down without a fight.

( 03:06:18 ) We begin with two men we're learning our charge with capital murder tonight accused of killing a twelve-year-old girl.

( 03:06:24 ) Police say these men strangled her before dumping her into that creek. Both men were in the country illegally.

( 03:06:30 ) Apprehended, then released by border patrol less than three weeks before Jocelyn's death. The men accused of killing Jocelyn Nungare are affiliated with the gang known for brutal violence.

( 03:06:42 ) Kamala Harris was in charge of immigration in our borders. If we had better border policies and not open borders and not these catch-and-release policies, I truly believe this all could have been prevented. Under her being vice president of this country, my daughter's life was ripped away from her. She had her entire life ahead of her.

( 03:07:08 ) Happy birthday, dear Jocelyn.

( 03:07:14 ) My daughter is six feet in the ground based off of policies that she allowed to keep. Kamala Harris did have one job, and she not only failed not me, she failed my daughter. She failed Jocelyn. She was only 12. President Trump reached out, gave me his sincerest condolences as not a former president, but just as a father, someone who cares. I believe Donald Trump needs to be back in office. I can at least know that my next child will be safe in this country.

Donald Trump ( 03:08:08 ):

That's what we're allowing into our country. The day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begin. And the savages charged with brutalizing and murdering precious Jocelyn are members of the same vicious Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua that is taking over apartment complexes and unleashing a violent killing spree all over America. You probably read in Aurora, Colorado, and I think Colorado's going to vote for Trump because what's happening in Colorado is unbelievable. They're taking over the state. The radical-left Governor has no idea what to do. The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer. November 5th, 2024, election day will be Liberation Day in America. It'll be liberation in four days.

( 03:09:26 ) On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. I will rescue every city in town that has been invaded and conquered. These towns have been invaded and these towns have been actually conquered. Think it, we're talking about the United States of America, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail, or at a minimum, kick them the hell out of our country [inaudible 03:10:02]. To expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs like MS-thirteen, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Very tough one, to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole.

( 03:10:35 ) And I'm hereby calling today, I am calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. And I will immediately ban all sanctuary cities in the United States of America. They're sanctuaries for criminals. Despite all the damage she has caused, Kamala has spent the final week of her campaign comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. Three days ago, Joe Biden called our supporters garbage. Said we were garbage. It's not nice, is it? Not nice, Joe. It was so bad that the White House stenographer was ordered to change the transcript. That's like 60 Minutes taking out the answer to a question.

( 03:11:42 ) Did you see that we sued 60 Minutes and CBS [inaudible 03:11:46]. But the stenographers who were honest and they reported it, they were told to not put down what he said, put down a different answer. They couldn't do it because it's fraud. That's not what they heard. My response to Joe and Kamala is simple. You can't lead America if you don't love Americans. You can't, and you can't be president if you hate the American people. Kamala's closing message to America is that she hates you. There's got to be something there. I think she does. I do believe. Don't forget, she's from San Francisco. She's a Marxist, or as you would say, a communist from San Francisco. She destroyed the greatest city in the country probably. It's probably the best city in the country, was. My closing message is that I love America and I'm inviting you to join us in building an extraordinary future for our nation.

( 03:12:51 ) My oath of office is an oath of allegiance to you, the American people. And I'm asking for your vote, but I want you to know that whether or not you vote for me, when I win I will fight for you with every breath in my body, I will. What we have built is the biggest, broadest, most incredible coalition in the greatest political movement in American history. My God, it's the best movement, the biggest movement in the history of our country. I told Joe, I said, "Joe, it means make America great again. It's okay, Joe." We're seeing historic levels of support among Blacks, Hispanics and Asians, Jews, Catholics, evangelicals, and Mormons. They're all joining our cause in larger numbers than ever before. And now the most amazing thing is happening. We're also winning overwhelming support from your Muslim community right here in Michigan. Muslim and Arab right here in Michigan. That's something, that's progress. And I just came from an incredible meeting with the Lebanese community in Dearborn. Last week I was honored to be endorsed by a group of some of the most important imams and Muslim leaders in your state. And I'm also grateful to the mayors of Dearborn Heights, Bill Brazi. Bill. Bill Brazi. Where's Bill? Hello, Bill. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you.

( 03:14:29 ) And the mayor of Hamtramack, Dr. Amir Ghalab. Doctor, thank you very much, Mr. Mayor. They're great people. Many Muslim and Arab Americans have friends and family living in the Middle East and Kamala is campaigning with warmongers like Liz Cheney. How do you think that is? They want to get the Arab American vote. They want to get the Muslim votes. She picks Liz Cheney whose father virtually destroyed the Middle East, right? I don't think it's working out too well. It's interesting. If you give Liz Cheney, she talks big. Oh, I want war. She always wants war. Every time I was with her in the White House, we should attack this nation, that nation, nations that people never even heard of we should attack. She's a big tough guy. She's a big, tough one. She's a tough one. But if you gave Liz Cheney a gun and put her into battle facing the other side with guns pointing at her, she wouldn't have the courage or the strength or the stamina to even look the enemy in the eye.

( 03:15:46 ) She wouldn't have. She sits back in Washington. Oh, we ought to go and attack Iran, Iraq. We're going to attack everybody. That's why I broke up with her. All she wanted to do is go to war with everybody because she, like Kamala, is a stupid person. It's easy for her to say she wants to start wars from the comfort of her nice home or father's lavish home that he got from killing a big portion of the Middle East. You know that, right? He headed up a company that was a big company, a big beneficiary of the wars. These war hawks, they want to draft your kids to die in wars and they will never fight themselves. Liz Cheney wouldn't fight. I'll go with her. I'll go to the Middle East. I'll go wherever she wants and we'll fight. She doesn't have the guts to fight.

( 03:16:40 ) She's all talk and no action. She lost her seat for Congress from a great state. I love that state. I won that state by like 50 points or some crazy number. And she lost to a very good woman who ran against her, Harriet. How good is Harriet? So Liz, Cheney lost by almost 40 points. It's the biggest defeat in the history of the United States Congress. No other congressperson lost by that much. She lost by almost 40 points. Never seen anything like it. If Kamala wins, only death and destruction await because she is the candidate of endless wars. I am the candidate of peace. I am peace. People don't believe that [inaudible 03:17:29]. But I need every Muslim American in Michigan to get the hell out and vote please, Mr. Mayors. All right, we got to get them out and vote. No, we want peace. Who doesn't want peace? Only stupid people like Cheney. No, you give her a gun. Liz, we're going to a certain location in the world.

( 03:17:51 ) We're going to fight it out with them. Oh, please. I don't want to do it, but when she's there and there's no consequences, we should go to war with them.

Donald Trump ( 03:18:00 ):

… her and that idiot John Bolton, who was so stupid. But I loved him. You know why? He'd come into a room with me, would never say anything. And I'd be with foreign leaders. And I didn't even have to act tough because he said, "Look, that moron, John Bolton, he's crazy. He's the one with Dick Cheney, got Bush to go into the Middle East, right? Trump is going to go to war with us." And you know what would happen? They'd give me everything I wanted because the guy's a nut job. Kamala Harris's campaign is in total free fall. You see that. The press hates to admit it. I guess they want to hold it. Well, I don't want to be too cute with these statements. I want to be a little careful because you got to still get out and vote. But if you get out and vote, we're going to win this thing in records that nobody's ever seen before. You got to get out. "Harry, get up and vote. You're coming with me, Harry. Get the hell out of that sofa, Harry." "But I'm watching the game." "Get out, Harry, let's go. We're going to vote for the president." And he votes. And you know what? Harry will feel much better. He's going to feel much better because everyone can see that she's totally unqualified to be the President of the United States. And she is.

( 03:19:19 ) Everything Kamala says is a lie. I watched her yesterday. Such lies. Her entire campaign is one hoax and slander after another. But the more they lie, the more they smear and the more they tell untruths, we have to go out and we have to get to vote. No, she'll say everything, or, "Trump will never frack." Oh, really? "Trump will never drill." Oh, really? I'll drill. The first day, we're going to start drilling. Going to make our country rich.

( 03:19:52 ) Everything she said, "Oh, Trump will end Social Security." No, I'm the one that didn't end it for four years. She's the one that's going to force its ending because of millions of people. Look, we gave you a stat before all the jobs that are leaving, but we gave you a stat and what did that stat say? It said that all of our jobs are being taken by the migrants that come into our country illegally. And many of those migrants happen to be criminals and some of them happen to be murderers, and they're taking the jobs away from the Black population and so far to a lesser extent from the Hispanic population. But that will change too.

( 03:20:29 ) The only way to stop the lies is to swamp them with our votes. We're going to swamp them. Kamala has no vision, no ideas. She has no solutions whatsoever. All she can talk. And it's true, all she can do. I watched her yesterday. All she can do is talk about Donald Trump.

Kamala Harris ( 03:20:49 ):

Good evening, everyone. Tonight I will speak about Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Trump.

Donald Trump ( 03:21:07 ):

That was yesterday. I'm watching it. I'm saying, "Oh."

Audience ( 03:21:07 ):

Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump. Donald Trump.

Donald Trump ( 03:21:07 ):

Thank you.

Audience ( 03:21:07 ):

Donald Trump. Donald Trump.

Donald Trump ( 03:21:26 ):

No, I was watching yesterday, "Trump, Trump, Trump did it." Why the hell didn't she fix this stuff? I mean, now she said, "I'm going to do this or that or this."

( 03:21:36 ) There are some people who thrive under pressure and there are some people who crack under pressure. And the more pressure Kamala has, Kamala, the more pressure that Kamala has, the worse she's crumbled. I watched her two days ago. She's exhausted. I mean, I've been doing 62 days without a day off and I am inspired, actually. It's crazy, right? I'm actually inspired. I don't know, maybe I shouldn't be, but I am.

( 03:22:12 ) She's so rattled and frightened that she couldn't even do an interview with a great guy named Joe Rogan. Couldn't do it. And if she can't handle an interview, she sure as hell can't handle President Xi, can she? She can't handle President Xi of China. She will get overwhelmed, she will meltdown, and millions of people will die with her stupidity. They got us into Ukraine. We should have never gone into Ukraine. If I was president, you would've never gone into Ukraine.

( 03:22:47 ) This is not a charity event. This is an election for the biggest and toughest job in human history. This is the biggest job in history. And on top of it, we have to save our country. Do you want to lose your life savings because we put a weak and foolish person in the White House? Do you want to lose your job and maybe your house and pension because Kamala has the economic understanding of a child? She's like a child. I watch her. I'm good at this stuff. I watch her. She doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.

( 03:23:19 ) And every one of those companies will move. They'll move to Asia. They'll move to Europe. They'll move. Everybody wants those companies, but we do too. And we're not letting them go. Take a look at what we did with John Deere. I mean, I just heard it just recently that John Deere has announced that they're not going to move to Mexico. If they do move to Mexico, they're going to pay a big price. They can sell anywhere they want, but they're not selling in the United States of America, okay? And I like John Deere and I'm a big customer of John Deere and maybe they'll red-flag me. They'll say, "You can't buy from John Deere," and I'll buy from somebody else if I have to. But they're not going to move their manufacturing plants to Mexico unless they want to pay a very big price.

( 03:24:06 ) This presidency is a job held by Teddy Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, people of strength and intelligence. Would you trust Kamala Harris to talk to Russia or China and talk them out of a war? "Let's talk." I don't think you would. Would you trust her to steer us out of an economic calamity she has put us into? We are right now, we had the lowest job numbers I think I've ever heard. I've never heard of 12,000 jobs, John, have you? I don't think so. We've done this for a long time. I don't think I've ever heard of 12,000 jobs.

( 03:24:48 ) Nothing is more dangerous than to give a immense amount of power to a very weak and incompetent and low-IQ person. That's what you're giving. You're giving the presidency to a low-IQ person. We had that for four years. We can't take another four years. I mean, the mistakes this guy made, and she was there, right? She was there. She approved everything she said. She'd like to have that statement back. You wouldn't put Kamala Harris in charge of literally a kindergarten class. She wouldn't be able to do the job.

( 03:25:27 ) So at the end of the day, you need to ask yourself, can you afford to put someone this incompetent in charge of our country's future? No, you can't. On top of it all, Kamala says she would do one thing, remember this, she would do one thing different and then she took it back because she forgot the thing. So she said she wouldn't do anything different than Joe Biden, which is disqualifying. They've got almost a 90% wrong track. You know, right track, wrong track? It's the highest wrong track in the history of our country, almost 90%. It's disqualifying. Take a look at this.

Speaker 12 ( 03:26:14 ):

Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?

Kamala Harris ( 03:26:20 ):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 13 ( 03:26:22 ):

I stood there on the tarmac watching you check your watch.

Speaker 17 ( 03:26:25 ):

The chaotic and deadly US evacuation from Afghanistan stunned Americans and the world and cost the lives of 13 US soldiers.

Speaker 12 ( 03:26:33 ):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris ( 03:26:35 ):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 14 ( 03:26:37 ):

More than 13,000 illegal immigrants convicted of murder have been caught at the border and then released into the United States.

Speaker 15 ( 03:26:44 ):

An Afghan national is in custody today after being accused of plotting an Election Day terrorist attack. The suspect entered the US on a special immigrant visa.

Speaker 16 ( 03:26:52 ):

Gut-wrenching new details in the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley. The illegal immigrant suspect who cops say committed the heinous murder is a Venezuelan national who crossed the unsecured southern border back in 2022.

Speaker 18 ( 03:27:05 ):

Two men investigators say are in the country illegally from Venezuela are charged with capital murder in the death of Jocelyn Nungaray.

Speaker 19 ( 03:27:11 ):

A fifth illegal immigrant accused of attacking two New York City police officers over the weekend showed no remorse or regret.

Speaker 12 ( 03:27:19 ):

Would you have done something differently?

Kamala Harris ( 03:27:21 ):

There is not a thing that comes to mind.

Speaker 20 ( 03:27:24 ):

Only 18% say the economy is in excellent or good condition.

Speaker 21 ( 03:27:27 ):

US inflation has hit a new 40- year high, increasing by 9.1% over the financial year.

Speaker 22 ( 03:27:34 ):

Authorities say Tren de Aragua, which has been linked with more than a hundred criminal investigations here in the US, has now been found operating its criminal enterprise in apartment complexes.

Speaker 23 ( 03:27:44 ):

Were you the last person in the room?

Kamala Harris ( 03:27:46 ):

Yes.

Donald Trump ( 03:27:54 ):

Wouldn't come to mind, not a thing. Nothing comes to her mind, let me tell you. It wasn't so much that she… Nothing comes to her mind because she's stupid. Now, can you imagine? You know the worst thing of all? 325,000 children are missing or dead. They came through the border. Think of that, 300… We're not talking two or three, which is too many, 325,000 children went through her stupid open border and now they're either missing, dead, or slaves. If you want to end this disaster, you must get out and vote.

( 03:28:33 ) We're pleased to be joined today, and I hope this happens because he's really good, by your next senator from the great state of Michigan, Mike Rogers. Mike, thank you. Come on, Mike.

Mike Rogers ( 03:28:58 ):

Well, thank you, Mr. President, for a couple of things. First of all, standing up for manufacturing in Michigan. That's exciting. You cannot be a great country if you can't build things. Donald J. Trump understands that for our state and our nation. For that, I thank you. I tell you the biggest endorsement, we should be able to drop the mic and be done, tells you everything you need to know. As the President said, he got customs or the Border Patrol Agents Association endorsement. Kamala Harris got the IRS agents endorsement. Do we need to say any more than that?

( 03:29:36 ) And I just want to say a quick thing. Thank you, Mr. President for… And I look forward to working with you to close this border. I met with a group and they're called Fentanyl Fathers and it's parents who have lost children to fentanyl poisoning. 3,000 of our Michigan citizens died last year because of fentanyl poisoning that came across our southern border. I look forward to not only closing the border but putting those cartels on the terrorist list and make sure that they are held accountable for the deaths that they're bringing to our communities. And we're also going to hold accountable China for the precursors that they're sending there on purpose to kill our children in Michigan and around the country. We can do it, but the only way that we're going to do that is having Donald J. Trump re-elected as the 47th President of the United States of America.

( 03:30:41 ) So I'm going to extend an invitation to you, Mr. President, right here, right now. We're going to both win because we're going to get out and work as hard as we can the next few days and we're going to take a couple of those plastic fold-up chairs and we're going to sit outside of the majority leader's office in the Senate, I'm buying the popcorn, and we're going to watch Chuck Schumer schlep out of that office and down the hall so that we can make America great again. Thank you for what you're doing. Thank you for your energy, Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 03:31:20 ):

Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. I see a very good Hulk Hogan look-alike. Look at that guy. The only thing I thought is Hulk's about six inches taller, maybe seven, eight, maybe not. Thank you. You look good. You look damn good anyway. But I know Hulk. He's that tall son of gun. How good was Hulk the other night, right? Wasn't he? Right?

( 03:31:48 ) I also want to thank Senators Eric Schmitt and Markwayne Mullin, two of the great senators of our country. They're here someplace and I want to thank them very much. Thank you. Two great senators and great people. Congressman John James, a friend of mine for a long time and he's doing a great job. Great job, John. And you're doing well. Lisa McClain. Lisa. Look at Lisa. These are warriors. These are great people. Thank you, Lisa. Thank you. You look great.

( 03:32:24 ) John Moolenaar. John. Hi, John. Thank you, John. Tim Walberg. Thank you, Tim. Good job, Tim. They're great people. They fight hard. They love your state. They love, I'll tell you, they love this country. And Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Oh. He's so good. He's so good. He's so great. Thank you, Bobby. And a man who I implored. I said, "Pete, you got to do it. You got to be Michigan GOP chairman." And he was very, very successful, as you know, politically. He was a great congressman. Everything he did was successful. And he was sort of like me. He didn't need this. And he said, "I'll do it." Pete Hoekstra, head of the GOP, chairman, thank you. Great. We're doing okay? We're going to pull it off, four days. Going to win? He said you're going to win. If he says you're going to win, that's good news. He knows how to win I can tell you that.

( 03:33:34 ) Mayor of Riverview, Andrew Swift. Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Andrew. Mayor of Garden City, Mark Jacobs. Thank you, Mark. Got all the big mayors here today. Township Supervisor Grosse Ile, James Budny. Thank you very much. Thank you. Mayor of Southgate, Joseph Kuspa. And City Council President, Zoey Kuspa. A little relationship there, I guess.

( 03:34:08 ) President of the Michigan Police Officers Association, James Tignanelli. And he was so nice, he gave me a big award the other day. We have the endorsement of every single police group. And Brian Pennebaker you met before. And Brian, I want to thank you. Brian Pennebaker. He's been so incredible. And Dr. Massad Boulos, I want to just thank you very much. You've worked so brilliantly with everybody. And my friend Steve Witkoff, who's a great developer and an amazing guy. Thank you, Steve.

( 03:34:48 ) Here are the facts just in closing. Kamala is a radical left Marxist rated even worse than crazy Bernie Sanders and Pocahontas herself. She destroyed our economy. She was an original creator of the defund the police movement, and anybody who wants to defund the police for even one week is not worthy of being President of the United States. Kamala vowed to abolish ICE. She pledged to confiscate your guns. I don't think so. Would anybody like to give up their gun? Please stand up. And endorsed a total ban on handgun ownership. And she even called for free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention, all on taxpayer expense. But perhaps most significant of all, she lied about working at McDonald's. She never worked at McDonald's.

( 03:35:52 ) With your vote this November, we are going to fire Kamala and we are going to save America. We will cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages, and bring thousands and thousands of factories back to America and back to Detroit, Michigan and Michigan. Thank you. We will build American. We will buy American. And we will hire American.

( 03:36:22 ) I will end the war in Ukraine. Would've never started if I was president. I will stop the chaos in the Middle East. Would've never happened, October 7th. And I will prevent World War III from happening. We will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources, and respect that they so dearly deserve. We will strengthen and modernize our military. We will build a missile defense shield, the biggest in the world all over our country, made in the USA, much of it made in Michigan. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. Our cities are a mess. They're a mess, a crime-ridden mess.

( 03:37:10 ) We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And I'm going to put a bill in. If you burn the American flag, you get one year in jail. Just happened a few weeks ago in Washington. They're burning American flags all over the place. We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our school. And we will keep men out of women's sports. I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech, and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms, our Second Amendment, which is under siege. After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our country, defend our borders, and protect our citizens and our lands. And we will stop illegal immigration once and for all. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be overrun. We will not be conquered. We will be a free, proud nation once again. We're going to be free and proud. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope. And most importantly, it's going to be filled again with the American Dream. We're going to fill it up with the American Dream for you, but for your kids. Your kids want the American Dream brought back. But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala Harris and stop her radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig. Get out and vote.

( 03:39:12 ) For the past nine years, we have been fighting against the most sinister and corrupt forces on earth. You know that. With your vote in this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. It was hardworking patriots like you who built this country, and four days from now it is hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country.

( 03:39:47 ) After all we have been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. We can do that. It seems unlikely, doesn't it? But we can do it. We're going to do it very fast. With your help from now until Election Day, we will restore America's promise and we will take back the nation that we love. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in. We will never give up. We will never back down and we will never, ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight and win, win, win. We're going to win again.

( 03:40:34 ) November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. And together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. Thank you, Bobby. Thank you, Bobby. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Michigan. God bless you all. God bless you, Michigan.
