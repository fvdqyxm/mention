Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Hello everybody.

Speaker 1 ( 00:02 ):

How you doing, Mr. President?

Donald Trump ( 00:03 ):

How're you?

( 00:05 ) Bumpy weather way up in the air. A little bit bumpy. So what's the word? Do you have any questions.

Speaker 1 ( 00:12 ):

Sir, could you tell us a little bit about how the Lula meeting went yesterday?

Donald Trump ( 00:16 ):

Very good. We had a good meeting. We'll see what happens. I don't know if anything's going to happen, but we'll see. They'd like to do a deal. We'll see. Right now they're paying, I guess, 50% tariff. But we had a great meeting. It's happy birthday. I want to wish the president happy birthday. Okay? It's his birthday today, did you know that?

Speaker 1 ( 00:37 ):

No.

Donald Trump ( 00:37 ):

He's a very vigorous guy actually, and I was very impressive. But today's his birthday, so happy birthday. All right. Would you let him know please.

Speaker 1 ( 00:46 ):

Mr. President, a couple more questions on tariffs. Secretary Bessent and Jamieson Greer-

Donald Trump ( 00:50 ):

He's right here.

Speaker 1 ( 00:51 ):

… That both said-

Donald Trump ( 00:53 ):

Where is he? He's right here. The handsome guy behind me.

Speaker 1 ( 00:54 ):

Hi, Mr. Secretary. You said you're near a framework to prevent-

Donald Trump ( 00:58 ):

Stand right over here. Wait, let me just give him a little room.

Speaker 1 ( 01:00 ):

Hi Mr. Secretary.

Donald Trump ( 01:02 ):

He's doing a good job.

( 01:02 ) No, get over here.

( 01:04 ) We also have Marco here.

Speaker 1 ( 01:07 ):

Can you give us a status on the preliminary talks with the Chinese, and where that sets things up for Thursday's meeting?

Speaker 2 ( 01:12 ):

So we had a very good meeting, Jamieson, myself, with our counterpart, the vice Premier, and we have a framework for President Trump, President Xi to decide on. And we discussed a wide range of things from tariffs, trade, fentanyl, substantial purchase of US agricultural products-

Speaker 1 ( 01:37 ):

And rare earths?

Speaker 2 ( 01:39 ):

… and rare earths.

Speaker 1 ( 01:40 ):

That's most important.

Donald Trump ( 01:41 ):

But nothing has been agreed to yet.

Speaker 1 ( 01:43 ):

How do you feel?

Donald Trump ( 01:44 ):

We feel good. We feel good. I feel better that this guy's got nice broad shoulders. If the plane makes a big turn or something, I'm grabbing his shoulder.

Speaker 1 ( 01:53 ):

Please, do.

Donald Trump ( 01:54 ):

You know what? Why don't you stay over here. Marco, where are you? Come on over here. We'll go over here. I think you have some more room for yourself.

( 01:59 ) I got a good team. This is the greatest team ever assembled.

( 01:59 ) Do you know that if I were an elected president, in my opinion, every automobile company in the United States would be either bankrupt, or very close to it. And instead they're hitting record highs. Their stock is through the roof. You saw Ford, and you saw General Motors yesterday go up big. It's all because of tariffs. If it weren't tariffs, it'd be just like it's been for the last 30 years, where we lost about 52% of our automobile manufacturing business. In my opinion, whether it be now, or very shortly, if it weren't for what I've done as president, every automobile company in America would be bankrupt. Instead, they're doing phenomenal business. That's all because of tariffs. All right.

Speaker 1 ( 02:51 ):

On the flight yesterday you said, no, you're too social about the Canada Tariffs. Can you walk through when you expect those to take effect, and can I ask why-

Donald Trump ( 02:59 ):

No, no, we're going to let them know. Ronald Reagan loved tariffs. He used them sparingly, which he probably would make a mistake… He made a mistake in that. And again, I was the biggest fan of Ronald Reagan, but on finance, on trade, it wasn't his strong suit, but he liked tariffs. And they totally changed that to say that he didn't because they're catering to the Supreme Court. Because Canada has been ripping us off for a long time, and they're not going to rip us off anymore. Canada has been ripping us off for a long time. One of the most difficult countries to deal with has been Canada. As much as I love Canada itself, and the people of Canada, they've just had a lot of bad representatives.

( 03:44 ) They did a fake ad yesterday. They were caught. The Ronald Reagan Foundation was the one that caught them, and it was totally the opposite of what they said. So I don't like that. That's dirty pool. You can't do that. And let me just tell you, they shouldn't have done it. They've apologized and they said we're going to take the ad down. Well, they did it, but they did it very late. They let it play for another two nights, and now they took that ad down. So I don't know when it's going to kick in, we'll see. But I don't really want to discuss it.

( 04:15 ) Let's go.

Speaker 1 ( 04:16 ):

Sorry, Mr. President, that was an ad run by a provincial government in Canada. Why are you mad with the federal government?

Donald Trump ( 04:22 ):

I don't care. Because whether it's provincial or Canada itself, they all knew exactly what the ad was. The Prime Minister knew, everybody knew. The Prime Minister knew what the end was, before I went on.

Speaker 1 ( 04:34 ):

Will you see him? In the effect, do you want to meet with him?

Donald Trump ( 04:37 ):

I don't want to meet with him, no. I'm not going to be meeting with him for a while, no. I'm very happy with the deal we have right now with Canada. We're going to let it ride.

Speaker 1 ( 04:44 ):

Well, we have secretary back in here.

( 04:45 ) Could we ask about the Fed search as well? Where are you on interviewing candidates for a new chair?

Speaker 2 ( 04:50 ):

We're down to five. We're obviously traveling a lot now. We're going to continue. We're going to do a second round, and we hope to present a good slate to the president right after Thanksgiving. It'll ultimately be his choice. I think he's got some very strong-

Donald Trump ( 05:07 ):

I'm thinking about him for Fed, what do you think?

Speaker 1 ( 05:09 ):

Thinking about Secretary Bessent?

Donald Trump ( 05:10 ):

I'm thinking about Marco, I'm thinking about Jamieson. I'm thinking about a lot of people.

Speaker 1 ( 05:16 ):

I think, Stephen Miller.

Donald Trump ( 05:17 ):

We do have a lot of… Stephen Miller. How about Stephen Miller? We have a lot of candidates that want the job.

Speaker 1 ( 05:23 ):

When do you think you'll make a decision?

Donald Trump ( 05:24 ):

I think it's the world's easiest job, but to get it right, you have to be very smart. And we have a person that's not at all smart right now, unfortunately. He should have been much lower, much sooner. That's why we call him Jerome-too late-Powell.

Speaker 1 ( 05:38 ):

Russia said this week that they tested a new missile that can go more than 8,000 miles. Is that saber-rattling for you? What is that?

Donald Trump ( 05:47 ):

They know we have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores. So it doesn't have to go 8,000 miles. And they're not playing games with us. We're not playing games with them either. We test missiles all the time, but we do have a submarine, a nuclear submarine, we don't need to go 8,000 miles. And I don't think it's an appropriate thing for Putin to be saying either, by the way. You ought to get the war ended. A war that should have taken one week is now in its, soon, fourth year. That's what he ought to do instead of testing missiles.

Speaker 1 ( 06:25 ):

Mr. President, should the EU use frozen Russian assets to help pay for defense of Ukraine?

Donald Trump ( 06:33 ):

I don't know. This you have to ask EU. I'm not involved in that. That's up to EU.

Speaker 1 ( 06:37 ):

Are you considering additional sanctions against Russia?

Donald Trump ( 06:41 ):

You'll find out.

Speaker 1 ( 06:42 ):

So Mr. president shipbuilding has been a big part of your trade deals with both South Korea and Japan. Why is it so important to increase our shipbuilding to counter China?

Donald Trump ( 06:54 ):

Well, pretty obvious answer to that because we want more ships. We're going to be back in the shipbuilding industry. We have a lot of companies coming into our country now. They're going to start building. We have the shipyards available. In World War II, we were the biggest in the world in shipbuilding. And then over the years we went wokey and stupid and weak, and we started buying ships from everybody, and we lost that industry. But we'll get that industry back. We were the best at it, and we'll soon be very good at it, if not the best.

Speaker 1 ( 07:26 ):

What are you going to announce in Japan? Can you give us any preview?

Donald Trump ( 07:29 ):

We're going to just announce great friendship. I look forward to meeting the new Prime Minister. I hear phenomenal things. She was a great ally, and friend of Shinzo Abe, who was my friend, the former prime minister, and he was great. He was one of my best… He was one of the best. And in the group, he was one of the best. Really best. And I know they were very close and I think philosophically they were close, which is good. It's going to be very good. That really helps Japan, and the United States. I think she's going to be great.

Speaker 1 ( 08:00 ):

Which CEOs are going to come to your dinner tomorrow? Can you say what companies-

Donald Trump ( 08:03 ):

I'd rather not say. You'll see tomorrow.

Speaker 1 ( 08:05 ):

Are you planning to sign the final deal on TikTok on Thursday when you meet-

Donald Trump ( 08:10 ):

We might. We might. That'll be one of the things we're discussing. Somebody reported, it's been approved recently. We got an original approval from President Xi. I expect we'll have an approval, but I'd rather wait till a couple of days to let you know.

Speaker 1 ( 08:25 ):

Is it part of the grand deal coming-

Donald Trump ( 08:27 ):

No, but it is something we're going to talk about.

Speaker 1 ( 08:30 ):

75% tariffs on China, is the understanding from both countries that will remain regardless of-

Donald Trump ( 08:36 ):

No, I don't want to tell you what the understanding is because what we understood yesterday or two days ago or even today, is not going to be necessarily what it's going to be in two days. We're going to have a great talk. I have a lot of respect for President Xi. I like him a lot, he likes me a lot, I believe. And respects me, and I think he respects our country a lot. And we're going to have… I think we're going to have a successful transaction

Donald Trump ( 09:00 ):

… for both countries.

Speaker 3 ( 09:01 ):

Sir, have you been briefed on the incident on the Nimitz, both the fighter jet and the helicopter?

Donald Trump ( 09:05 ):

Yeah, I've heard of that. Yeah.

Speaker 3 ( 09:06 ):

Do you know what happened there? Was that-

Donald Trump ( 09:08 ):

They're going to let me know pretty soon. I think they should be able to find out. It could be bad fuel. I mean it's possible it's bad fuel. Very unusual that that would happen to be-

Speaker 3 ( 09:16 ):

You don't think there was foul play or anything?

Donald Trump ( 09:18 ):

No, I don't think so.

Speaker 3 ( 09:18 ):

Security thing or anything.

Donald Trump ( 09:19 ):

No. I don't think so. They think it might be bad fuel. We're going to find out. Nothing to hide. We'll find out.

Speaker 1 ( 09:23 ):

Sir, has there been a snag in terms of the South Korea trade talks? How is that going?

Donald Trump ( 09:28 ):

No, I don't think so. Scott, is it?

Scott Bessent ( 09:29 ):

No, there are just a lot of details to work out. It's a very complicated deal and I think we're very close.

Speaker 1 ( 09:38 ):

Do you expect to finalize that on Wednesday or will it maybe not quite be done?

Scott Bessent ( 09:41 ):

I think not quite, but I think the overall framework is done for just crossing the Ts, dotting the Is. That's what ambassador of Korea's team does and nobody's better at it than they are.

Speaker 1 ( 09:55 ):

Mr. President-

Donald Trump ( 09:56 ):

You want to say something?

Speaker 4 ( 09:58 ):

Sure. So with the Korea deal, there are a few parts to this. There's some national security-related issues, which are really not in my real house and we have some pure trade issues where they've had some non-terror barriers to us for a long time and we've resolved a lot of those, so that's great. And then there's another piece which is really about investment going forward. The Koreans have a great plan to invest in US shipbuilding, even more than they've already done it, and so they're talking right now frankly about how to implement Korean investment in the United States in the best way to make sure that we're-

Donald Trump ( 10:28 ):

And especially towards shipbuilding.

Speaker 4 ( 10:30 ):

Exactly. Right.

Donald Trump ( 10:30 ):

We're very much involved in getting the shipbuilding going again, which really we should have never lost. Years ago they lost that. Many decades ago. But we were number one. We'll be either number one or right up the round-up. China's making a lot of ships. I take my hat off to them. Now they wouldn't if we had that situation where we charged, essentially, a fee, but we're not looking to hurt their shipbuilding in this.

Speaker 1 ( 10:57 ):

Have the Koreans asked for any EPs and guarantees after that immigration raid?

Donald Trump ( 11:04 ):

No, but you know how I feel. I was very much opposed. When they come in and they're making very complex machinery, equipment things, they're going to have to bring some people in, at least at the initial phase. In that case it was batteries. Batteries are very complex and they're actually very dangerous to make. You can't just pick people off an unemployment line and say, "We just opened up a $2 billion battery factory." So we've got an understanding. And this is with the world. By the way, this is not just with South Korea, this is… When they come into our country… We have a lot of factories being built by outside, by foreign interests. When they come in, some of these factories make very, very complex, very highly sophisticated equipment. They've got to bring people in with them for a period of time. They'll teach our people how to do it, but even for a fairly long period of time, they're going to need expertise to be successful.

( 12:02 ) And we're going to let people know. I'm letting them know right now that when they come into our country, we can expect to see them bring in with them some very talented people that have been doing it for many years. They'll teach our people how to do it. Our people will be just as good as they are within a period of time and it'll be a phase-out. But we want them to bring in experts and that's the way it is.

Speaker 5 ( 12:25 ):

Mr. President, what visa would they come under and for how long would that be?

Donald Trump ( 12:29 ):

We're going to have that set. We're doing a whole new plan for that. But what you can expect. Let's say they come in. For instance, we have massive number of chip companies. In particular, one the biggest by far and the biggest in the world coming in. You can't expect them to make unbelievably complex chips and computers and other things and pick people off the unemployment line that haven't worked in five years. So I want them to come in with talented people and it'll be a slow phase-out.

Speaker 1 ( 13:03 ):

Did I hear you right when you said you were opposed to the way that raid in Georgia was hit?

Donald Trump ( 13:07 ):

I was opposed to getting them out. And in fact before they got out they were pretty well-set. But before they got out I said they could say they went, they left and they're going to be coming back.

Speaker 1 ( 13:18 ):

Right. Did you see the results from the Argentina election? It looks like Milea's party-

Donald Trump ( 13:21 ):

Wow. What a great question that is. I love that question 'cause that was a big win in Argentina. I want to congratulate the victor and he was a big victor and he had a lot of help from us. He had a lot of help. I gave him a very strong endorsement and it was really unexpected to have a victory of that… Some people thought it would be hard to win and not only did he win, he won by a lot. So Argentina, that was a great thing and I give Scott and I gave James and everybody, Marco, a lot of credit for that because we are sticking with a lot of the countries in South America. We're focused very much on South America and we're getting a real strong handle in South America in a lot of ways, including the fact that we don't want their drugs. We don't want drugs coming into our country and you're seeing them.

Speaker 1 ( 14:12 ):

You suggested that you might not receive, maybe with the swaps plan or with the changes to beef purchases, depending on the result of that election.

Donald Trump ( 14:19 ):

Well, we'll see. We'll see. We're going to take care of our ranches one way though. We have two situations. The ranches, for 35 years, have done very poorly, the cattle people. They've done very, very poorly and now they're doing well but the price is up. So what I can see happening is we're going to take some beef because I have to get the price down. Most prices are down. If you look at energy and all the… I have things down, but beef is high and the cattle ranches are doing good. They backed me from day one. What we're going to do is we're going to make sure that they don't get hurt, but we have to also make sure that I get the prices down. I want to get the prices down like I did with eggs, like I did with lots of others.

( 14:59 ) We had a couple of them where, when I first took over, eggs were double and quadruple what they were. That was Biden's fault. A lot of this is Biden's fault too and we're going to get the price of beef down and I'm going to make sure the cattle ranches don't get hurt.

Speaker 6 ( 15:15 ):

Mr. President, you talked about North Korea on your way here. Have you heard anything back from Kim Jong Un?

Donald Trump ( 15:20 ):

I haven't mentioned it. I haven't said anything. But I'd love to meet with him if he'd like to meet. I got along great with Kim Jong Un. I liked him. He liked me. If he wants to meet, I'll be in South Korea.

Speaker 6 ( 15:34 ):

So you'd extend your trip in order to try to meet?

Donald Trump ( 15:37 ):

Say again?

Speaker 6 ( 15:37 ):

Would you extend your trip in Asia in order to meet with him?

Donald Trump ( 15:38 ):

Well, I hadn't thought of it, but I think the answer would be, yeah, I would do that. Sure. It's our last stop, so it's pretty easy to do. Yeah, I would do that.

Speaker 1 ( 15:48 ):

When you do meet with him, sir-

Donald Trump ( 15:50 ):

With Kim Jong Un.

Speaker 1 ( 15:51 ):

Yes. What does the US have to offer me?

Donald Trump ( 15:53 ):

Well, I didn't say I was meeting with him, but if he'd like to meet, I'm around. I'll be in South Korea so I could be right over there.

Speaker 1 ( 15:59 ):

But what could the US offer him at this point?

Donald Trump ( 16:02 ):

Well, we have sanctions. That's pretty big to start off with. I would say that's about as big as you get.

Speaker 1 ( 16:09 ):

Anything as like an inducement to do a deal?

Donald Trump ( 16:11 ):

No, I don't know. I just had a good relationship with him. I would love to see him if he wants to, if he even gets this message. We haven't mentioned that. Anybody knows I'm going over there. If he'd like to meet, I'd love to meet him.

Speaker 5 ( 16:23 ):

Are you concerned about flights being halted at LAX due to shortages for air traffic controllers? Is there a way we can pay them?

Donald Trump ( 16:32 ):

Yeah, there is, but the Democrats should just do a simple extension. That's the best way. The Democrats are holding it up. They want $1.5 trillion for people that came out of prisons or illegal aliens that come into our country. We don't want to do that 'cause that will really hurt the healthcare that we have in our country and frankly, we'd like to see better healthcare period. We're not looking to do that. The Democrats can solve that problem with air traffic control. All they have to do is say, "The country is open." We only need five votes. The Republicans are with us. We only need five votes. So let's see what happens. I would imagine that gets taken care of, not only the controllers, but other people too.

Speaker 5 ( 17:21 ):

How is your relationship with Elon these days and is there [inaudible 00:17:21]

Donald Trump ( 17:21 ):

I think it's good. You saw that. During Charlie's beautiful tribute, Elon came up. It's good with Elon. I like Elon. I've always liked Elon. Elon is good.

Speaker 5 ( 17:28 ):

Have you talked to him since the memorial?

Donald Trump ( 17:33 ):

On and off a little bit. Yeah. Very little. Nothing much. Look, he's a nice guy and he's a very capable guy. I've always liked him. He had a bad spell. He had a bad moment. It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that. But I like Elon and I suspect I'll always like him.

Speaker 1 ( 17:56 ):

Sir, what are your thoughts on the continued protests outside immigration centers in

Donald Trump ( 17:58 ):

Well, when

Speaker 1 ( 18:00 ):

… there is in Chicago?

Donald Trump ( 18:01 ):

Well, when people come into our country illegally, especially in terms of speed, the very bad ones, murderers… Because we've had murderers came in through the Biden administration. We have very tight borders now, but we had open borders. Incredibly we had open borders. What were they thinking? But we have murderers. Over 11,000 murderers came in, many of them murdered more than one person. We want those people out. We want people that were in prisons, we want them to go back to their prison, not our prison. We want them out, and we'll get them out, get them all out.

Speaker 1 ( 18:36 ):

Do you think deportations-

Donald Trump ( 18:36 ):

It was really a terrible mistake that was made. When you think of it, so much of our time is spent on that subject, and it's a big subject, because it's probably 20 or 25 million people, the real number, and of the 25 million people, it's millions of people should not be here. Now, all of them shouldn't be here if they came in illegally, but we have to get the criminals out. Washington D.C. is doing great. Memphis is starting to do great, we just started there two weeks ago. Any place we touch is going to do well. If I were a governor, I'd say, "Please, get your people in. Whether it's National Guard or the military, get them in."

Speaker 7 ( 19:15 ):

Is there a deadline?

Donald Trump ( 19:16 ):

And as you know, we've been winning those cases.

Speaker 7 ( 19:18 ):

Is there a deadline for San Francisco to get their [inaudible 00:19:21]

Donald Trump ( 19:22 ):

Yeah, I'd like to do it, but I have a lot of very important people that are really into San Francisco that are really trying to do it themselves. I said, "We can do it better," because we have a strong group, a tough group, a group that has powers that other people don't have. Locally you don't have the powers that the federal government has, and we can do a better job of it faster.

( 19:45 ) But I listened to a few of the people. Jensen, who's fantastic, from Nvidia as you know, and Mark from [inaudible 00:19:55] magazine among a lot of other things, right? He's a good man. And they would love to give it a shot, and I say, "Go ahead, do it." And I would have done that with Chicago, but Chicago is very far along the way. We have to do something with that. I have a lot of friends influential in Chicago. If they call me, maybe I do the same thing. But we have to save Chicago immediately. We could do that pretty easily, but we have to get in quickly.

Speaker 8 ( 20:21 ):

[inaudible 00:20:22] back to Argentina, quickly.

Donald Trump ( 20:23 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 8 ( 20:23 ):

What do you think the state of the fiscal situation is there now? Do you think you'll have to do another deal?

Donald Trump ( 20:28 ):

Well, we have the all-time expert right here. I think right now we've made a lot of money based on that election, because the bonds have gone up, their whole debt rating has gone up. That election made a lot of money for the United States. Now we're not in that for money per se, but if you look at the value of the bonds, the debt… Scott, go ahead.

Scott Bessent ( 20:47 ):

Yeah, I think the great victory in this election, President Milei, I think, is going to expand his coalition, and they have some big refinancings next year, but the Argentinian people have spoken. They know that the U.S. is their ally thanks to President Trump, we're behind them, and that they're going to be able to fix their fiscal and keep on the road. He's working against a hundred years of bad policies, and he's going to break them thanks to support for the United States. [inaudible 00:21:24]

Donald Trump ( 21:23 ):

And we're helping other South American countries also, as you know.

Speaker 8 ( 21:26 ):

Will they need more support, or would you consider it, if they need it?

Donald Trump ( 21:30 ):

We might. Yeah, we would consider it, I think.

Scott Bessent ( 21:31 ):

Yeah-

Donald Trump ( 21:32 ):

We think they'll be in good shape.

Scott Bessent ( 21:33 ):

Yeah, we think the market's going to do it from here, now that he's gotten over this. As I always said, this was a bridge. We've bridged him thanks to President Trump's support. He did better than anyone ever expected. The Peronists said, "It wasn't a fair election, because we were running against Donald Trump too." And now I think the market is going to take care of itself, and it's going to have a lot of confidence in his policies and the way forward.

Donald Trump ( 21:58 ):

The polls were very wrong on that election. I mean, the polls really got it wrong. That was an election they said was going to be lost, and not only was it won, but it was won by a lot. And maybe we did help. I hope we helped.

Speaker 9 ( 22:12 ):

Sir, for you or Secretary Rubio. Over the weekend, Israel assassinated a military official of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement. Does that violate the ceasefire law between Israel and Hamas, or are they treated as a separate group?

Marco Rubio ( 22:27 ):

You talking about the strike against the Palestinian Jihad individual?

Speaker 9 ( 22:30 ):

Yes.

Marco Rubio ( 22:30 ):

Yeah, look, Israel didn't surrender its right to self-defense. Obviously the ceasefire is based on obligations on both sides. By the way, we'd also like to see Hamas speed up the return of hostage bodies. We still have 13 hostages, two Americans included. But we don't view that as a violation of the ceasefire. They have a right [inaudible 00:22:48] there's an imminent threat to Israel, and all the mediators agree with that.

Donald Trump ( 22:51 ):

How transparent is the Trump administration? You got Scott, you got Jamieson, you got Marco. We're not saying, "Please don't ask this question." You can ask anything you want. There's never been anything like this. Do you agree with that?

Speaker 10 ( 23:07 ):

Well, I just want to ask a clarifying question from my earlier thing. You said five fed candidates. That's Waller [inaudible 00:23:15] Warsh, Rieder, and Bowman, right?

Scott Bessent ( 23:18 ):

Rieder. Rieder.

Speaker 10 ( 23:18 ):

Rieder.

Scott Bessent ( 23:18 ):

And Bowman.

Speaker 10 ( 23:25 ):

Bowman. [inaudible 00:23:26] surprise six occasionally [inaudible 00:23:27]

Donald Trump ( 23:26 ):

Well, he likes what he's doing to [inaudible 00:23:31] I don't think you could… You couldn't pull him out of there no matter what. It's like Caroline. How's Caroline doing? Good? Would you say she's doing good, or just okay? I think she's doing.

Speaker 10 ( 23:40 ):

She's been very gracious [inaudible 00:23:41]

Donald Trump ( 23:41 ):

She's doing very good.

Speaker 11 ( 23:41 ):

[inaudible 00:23:42] back here.

Scott Bessent ( 23:42 ):

Yes.

Donald Trump ( 23:45 ):

Yes. Without her we wouldn't be here right now. She's doing great.

Speaker 10 ( 23:49 ):

When do you think you'll make a decision on [inaudible 00:23:51]

Donald Trump ( 23:51 ):

I'd say maybe by the end of the year.

Scott Bessent ( 23:53 ):

Yeah, before Christmas. Right around…

Donald Trump ( 23:55 ):

I think by the end of the year, early next year. But by the end of the year. We want to get Too-Late out as soon as possible. We want to be too early with Too-Late.

Speaker 7 ( 24:04 ):

Sir, Steve Bannon said in a recent interview that there could be plans for you to be able to run and potentially win a third term in 2028. Is that something you'd be willing to challenge [inaudible 00:24:15]

Donald Trump ( 24:14 ):

Well, I haven't really thought about it. We have some very good people, as you know, but I have the best poll numbers I've ever had. I mean, I just solved eight wars, and a ninth is coming. I believe Russia-Ukraine will happen. But we just left, and when you look at the treaty we just did, that was a war that was… Thousands of people were already shot at the border, and when you look at what we just did, was pretty amazing. Pretty amazing. We got a lot of good credit, and I really have to thank Malaysia for that, because the prime minister and everybody really helped get the two countries together. But it was quite a great peace treaty. But that was one of eight, and makes me feel good. It's millions of people that we save. I saved the lives of millions of people. That's what's important. Yeah.

Speaker 11 ( 25:09 ):

Who are the very good people?

Donald Trump ( 25:12 ):

They are good people.

Speaker 11 ( 25:14 ):

You said that for 2028, they're very good people.

Speaker 8 ( 25:15 ):

Who are they?

Donald Trump ( 25:17 ):

Well, we have great people. Well, I don't have to get into that, but we have one of them standing right here. We have J.D. Obviously the vice president is great. I think Marco is great. I'm not sure if anybody would run against us. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable. I really do, I believe that. I would love to do it. And I have my best numbers ever. It's very terrible. I have my best numbers, if you read it.

Speaker 11 ( 25:47 ):

Not ruling out-

Donald Trump ( 25:48 ):

Am I not ruling it out? You'll have to tell me. All I can tell you is that we have a great group of people, which they don't. They have Jasmine Crockett, a low IQ person. They have… AOC's low IQ. You give her an IQ test… Have her pass the exams that I decided to take when I was at Walter Reed. Those are very hard. They're really aptitude tests, I guess in a certain way, but their cognitive tests. Let AOC go against Trump. Let Jasmine go against Trump. I don't think Jasmine… The first couple of questions are easy. A tiger, an elephant, a giraffe, you know. When you get up to about five or six, and then when you get up to 10 and 20 and 25… They couldn't come close to answering any of those questions.

Speaker 8 ( 26:36 ):

[inaudible 00:26:37] Walter Reed mentioned advanced medical imaging. Did you get an MRI? Can you tell us what that was?

Donald Trump ( 26:42 ):

I did, I got an MRI. I was perfect. Yep. I gave you the full results. We had an MRI in the machine, the whole thing, and it was perfect, yeah.

Speaker 8 ( 26:54 ):

Yeah. Can you say what in particular they were?

Donald Trump ( 26:55 ):

You could ask the doctors. In fact, we have doctors traveling with

Donald Trump ( 27:00 ):

… with us, but I think they gave you a very conclusive… Nobody has ever given you reports like I gave you. And if I didn't think it was going to be good either, I would let you know negatively I wouldn't run, I'd do something. But the doctor said some of the best reports for the age, some of the best reports they've ever seen.

Speaker 1 ( 27:19 ):

One theory on how you might try to serve a third term is that you could run as the vice president.

Donald Trump ( 27:25 ):

Yeah, I'd be allowed to do that.

Speaker 1 ( 27:26 ):

Is it the White House or the White House Councils or your legal position, I guess, [inaudible 00:27:31] do that?

Donald Trump ( 27:31 ):

No. You'd be allowed to do that, but I wouldn't do that. I think-

Speaker 1 ( 27:33 ):

You're ruling that out.

Donald Trump ( 27:34 ):

… it's too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute. I think the people wouldn't like that. It's too cute. It wouldn't be right.

Speaker 12 ( 27:43 ):

A golf-related question, do you mind? You're personally the most difficult shot for you in golf?

Donald Trump ( 27:52 ):

You mean right now?

Speaker 12 ( 27:53 ):

Well, yeah. How will you play it?

Donald Trump ( 27:55 ):

The most difficult shot? It used to be chipping, but I become a very good chipper. I hit them all pretty good. I'm a pretty good golfer. I won 38 club championships. That's pretty good. Pretty much I hit. I'm very solid, very consistent, pretty long. I mean, I hit the ball pretty long. I play with Gary Player. You know Gary's 90 and he shot 70 with me the last time we played, which is pretty amazing. From 60 is pretty good. Putting is pretty good. Yeah. I'd say putting used to be the best, but I'd say putting is pretty good.

Speaker 1 ( 28:34 ):

Sir, can I ask just one more trade question. There were some tweaks to the Vietnam deal where they're going to have some zero-tariff items that can come into the United States. Why was that change made?

Donald Trump ( 28:45 ):

I don't know.

Speaker 4 ( 28:46 ):

There's a handful of things like coffee, et cetera, the type of stuff we don't make in the United States or pro.

Donald Trump ( 28:52 ):

No, we don't make.

Speaker 4 ( 28:53 ):

[inaudible 00:28:53] we can. So it makes sense if people are going to do a deal with us, we'll give them a good deal there. But overall 20% on Vietnam.

Donald Trump ( 29:00 ):

And we want to get coffee down a little bit.

Speaker 1 ( 29:02 ):

So just to clarify, technically, that was stuff that was at 20 and now will be brought to zero.

Speaker 4 ( 29:07 ):

Well, it's just brought to whatever congressional level of tariff there is, right? I mean, we have a huge deficit with Vietnam. And so they've taken down all their tariffs to zero on everything.

Donald Trump ( 29:17 ):

All gone.

Speaker 4 ( 29:18 ):

All the non-tariff barriers gone. They're going to accept all our autos, all our standards, all of that. We have 20% on them.

Donald Trump ( 29:23 ):

Which by the way, people said impossible to get.

Speaker 4 ( 29:25 ):

They did say impossible.

Donald Trump ( 29:26 ):

They're all gone.

Speaker 4 ( 29:27 ):

Yep, yep. And so we just have a few items like that that we can't grow or extract from the ground in the United… Certain spices, right, if we don't grow in America, that kind of thing.

Speaker 1 ( 29:34 ):

How worried are you still about the risk of trans-shipping through Vietnam from China?

Speaker 4 ( 29:38 ):

So part of the deal, they've agreed to a duty evasion agreement with us. And if we catch them doing it, we can charge additional 40%. Right.

Speaker 1 ( 29:46 ):

On top of the 20.

Speaker 4 ( 29:48 ):

That's right. Yeah. And that's an executive order that's already in place.

Donald Trump ( 29:51 ):

You guys have a very interesting couple of days. We have Japan and then we have South Korea, but we have China coming. It's going to be very interesting. I have a lot of respect for President Xi and we are going to… I think we're going to come away with the deal. But I really feel good. Our country's doing so well economically. It's doing so incredibly well. The Democrats should let it open. I guess they don't do that because it's doing so well. It's too bad.

( 30:19 ) But on the macro scale, it's not having that kind of an effect. We just want people to get paid. We think it's very unfair. And how about the man that put up $130 million to make sure our military got paid?

Speaker 1 ( 30:34 ):

You won't tell who he is?

Donald Trump ( 30:35 ):

I won't tell you. I won't tell you.

Speaker 13 ( 30:36 ):

Isn't it [inaudible 00:30:37]?

Donald Trump ( 30:36 ):

But this is a person that called me that said, "Sir, I'd like to make a contribution of any difference needed for the United States military." I said, "I don't know. That could be a big number." And we worked it out. It was about $130 million. And he wrote a check for $130 million because he's an unbelievable patriot. And that's what it's all about. So we're going to have a good time over the next two days. Get a little rest.

Speaker 1 ( 31:02 ):

[inaudible 00:31:02] World Series at?

Donald Trump ( 31:04 ):

I haven't been watching it too much, the World Series. No. I'm disappointed they didn't put Pete Rose in. I said, "Put Pete Rose in before he dies. He had over 4,000 hits." They didn't do it. And with all the gambling you see now, I mean, give me a break. They didn't put Pete Rose in. I asked the commissioner, "Put Pete Rose in, Commissioner," long before he died. Like a year before he died. They didn't get it done. Should have gotten it done. Pete Rose was a great baseball player.

Speaker 14 ( 31:34 ):

One quick one, just you said yesterday that you might invite China to Mar-a-Lago.

Donald Trump ( 31:38 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 14 ( 31:39 ):

When would that be?

Donald Trump ( 31:40 ):

Well, sometime after… We pretty much agreed that I'll be going to China.

Speaker 14 ( 31:45 ):

When is that?

Donald Trump ( 31:46 ):

In the earlier part of the year.

Speaker 14 ( 31:47 ):

Okay.

Donald Trump ( 31:48 ):

And President Xi will be coming into maybe Washington or Palm Beach or someplace sometime after that.

Speaker 14 ( 31:54 ):

Vietnam said that you accepted an invitation there as well. Do you plan on visiting Vietnam?

Donald Trump ( 31:57 ):

Well, he invited me. If I can, I will. We have a good relationship with Vietnam. Look, they've made a lot of money with the United States over the years with presidents. Said, "Really didn't know what they were doing." But now as you know, Vietnam is not charging us tariffs and that's a big step. And based on that, I would. That's a big move.

Speaker 14 ( 32:18 ):

For Friday, Ambassador Greer launched a 301 on whether China reneged on its phase one deal. Is that part of these talks? Would you pause that? How connected is that to the Thursday talks to talks to [inaudible 00:32:29]?

Donald Trump ( 32:29 ):

It may be a part of the talk, but it may be a part of just the negotiation.

Speaker 4 ( 32:32 ):

That was a separate deal from before and there's a lot of view in the United States that they didn't keep aspects of that deal. So we're just looking into it as… That's continuing, but we're really focused on-

Donald Trump ( 32:42 ):

If all works out well, I'm sure they'll be able to talk us out of it. You agree?

Speaker 4 ( 32:47 ):

We'll see.

Donald Trump ( 32:47 ):

I think so.

Speaker 4 ( 32:48 ):

It's up to you, sir.

Donald Trump ( 32:49 ):

I have a feeling they'll talk us out of it.

Speaker 15 ( 32:51 ):

You long said that you have a great relationship with Xi Jinping. You really get along.

Donald Trump ( 32:55 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 15 ( 32:56 ):

Could you just elaborate on that? What about your relationship is so great and what about him [inaudible 00:33:00]?

Donald Trump ( 33:00 ):

I just like it. Obviously, that was hurt pretty badly by COVID when COVID came in through Wuhan. Everybody knows that. I always said, and I said it right from the beginning. So that had an impact but an impact for a lot of reasons. Number one, we didn't get to speak as much because we're all busy getting out of that nightmare. But no, I think I have a very good relationship, as good as anybody. And I would say that likewise with him. Thank you very much everybody.

Speaker 1 ( 33:30 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate it.

Speaker 16 ( 33:33 ):

Can I ask about the [inaudible 00:33:34] President has been following you around, Mr. President?

Speaker 1 ( 33:36 ):

Thank you, Secretary-
