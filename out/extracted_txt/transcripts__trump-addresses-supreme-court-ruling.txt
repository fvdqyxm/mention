Audience ( 01:30 ):

[inaudible 00:00:04].

( 01:30 ) Hi, how are you?

( 01:30 ) [inaudible 00:00:25].

( 01:30 ) Actually, our wedding was.

( 01:30 ) [inaudible 00:00:31].

( 01:30 ) But yes, [inaudible 00:00:35].

( 01:30 ) [inaudible 00:00:33].

( 01:30 ) [inaudible 00:00:35] was beautiful.

( 01:30 ) [inaudible 00:00:43].

( 01:30 ) Really?

( 01:30 ) [inaudible 00:00:46].

( 01:30 ) Yeah. Oh yeah.

( 05:52 ) Is that good?

( 05:52 ) Thanks.

( 05:52 ) Sure.

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:02:53].

( 05:52 ) Yeah, well, there's no [inaudible 00:03:00].

( 05:52 ) I know.

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:03:04].

( 05:52 ) Yeah. No, no. Yeah.

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:04:03].

( 05:52 ) I am [inaudible 00:04:06].

( 05:52 ) Go for it.

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:04:11].

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:04:13] I'm not saying that's true.

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:04:16].

( 05:52 ) Yeah.

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:04:48].

Crew ( 05:52 ):

Okay, Steve is now 87. So cut to [inaudible 00:05:53].

( 05:52 ) All right. Just [inaudible 00:05:53].

Audience ( 05:52 ):

[inaudible 00:05:53].

Crew ( 05:52 ):

Steven, we'll cut [inaudible 00:05:53].

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:05:53].

Audience ( 05:52 ):

[inaudible 00:05:53] send a test.

( 05:52 ) Send a [inaudible 00:05:53].

( 05:52 ) Send a test.

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:05:53].

( 05:52 ) Send a test.

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:05:53].

( 05:52 ) Thank you.

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:05:53].

Speaker 1 ( 05:52 ):

Dave, we can probably cut to that row.

Crew ( 05:52 ):

Thank you.

Speaker 1 ( 05:52 ):

I would cover it through [inaudible 00:05:53] more than one person.

Crew ( 05:52 ):

That's [inaudible 00:05:53].

( 05:52 ) [inaudible 00:05:53].

Speaker 1 ( 05:53 ):

Well, there's no question this is the end of a fairly extraordinary week for President Trump. If you think back, it was less than a week ago on last Saturday night when he addressed the nation talking about those extraordinary military strikes on Iran. Then of course, he went to the NATO summit in The Hague, and now he of course is back here. And he's expected to, I'm told, celebrate what he explained earlier as a giant win by the U.S Supreme Court talking about the birthright citizenship issue, of course, even though the court is going to rule on the merits of that later, but also to the idea of executive power.

( 06:26 ) Well, if you step back here after the first six months or so of the Trump administration, of this presidency, it's clear this is his Supreme Court. This is one of the major differences from his first term in office, of course. He has three justices that he appointed on the Supreme Court, and the judiciary across the country also has many Trump appointees.

( 06:45 ) Now, it's been a mixed bag, if you will, of rulings, as we've seen, but the ruling today by the court, it will not cause immediate relief, it will send many cases back to lower courts and open the door for class actions, but it signals one big question that all presidents have, certainly this president has, and that is the power of the executive branch, the power of the presidency.

( 07:08 ) And throughout the ruling, and I'm told that the president was hearing some passages from his advisors who were reading to him that a single judge cannot block the executive branch. So that is something I expect him to talk about here at the press briefing.

( 07:22 ) But it's also a moment for the president to talk about other challenges. He's staying in Washington this weekend, which is unusual. He normally goes to his golf club either at [inaudible 00:07:33] during the summer or Mar-a-Lago in the winter, but I'm told he's staying here to work with Senate Republicans. He wants them to get the job done to pass his signature legislation by July 4th. That is very much an open-ended questions, the timing at least, so I expect the president is also to make some more sales pitches, if you will, on that.

( 07:53 ) And there are some central questions over that bill as well. [inaudible 00:08:00] Republicans who are worried about the cuts in the bill, the effect it will have on rural hospitals across the country.

( 08:06 ) So much on the line, much at stake for the president. But for now at least, the end of the Supreme Court term is certainly something that the president would like to celebrate [inaudible 00:08:15].

Audience ( 08:11 ):

[inaudible 00:08:17].

Speaker 1 ( 08:44 ):

It is [inaudible 00:08:46], but by my memory at least, and we can check this, I believe it's only the second time he has had a news briefing here in the White House press room. The first was in the early days of his presidency after the tragic plane crash at National Airport, I think. He of course came in this briefing room and took questions. But you're right, he often does an exchange with reporters often on a near daily basis in the Oval Office or other places on this campus.

( 09:09 ) But no, there's no doubt this is a different moment, but he wants to obviously talk about and celebrate what he sees as a giant win, as he put it on Truth Social earlier this morning.

( 09:20 ) But also, think of all that's happened [inaudible 00:09:24] over the last week. [inaudible 00:09:25] extraordinary [inaudible 00:09:28] his foreign policy agenda as well as his domestic priorities as well. So it's a good, I guess, halfway mark of his first year in office for the president to come and take some questions. But we'll see what he does.

Audience ( 09:36 ):

[inaudible 00:09:46].

( 09:36 ) Yeah.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:10:36].

( 09:36 ) Yes, I'm in [inaudible 00:11:49].

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:11:51].

( 09:36 ) Okay.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:12:56].

( 09:36 ) All right.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:13:02].

( 09:36 ) It's five minutes [inaudible 00:13:36].

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:13:38].

( 09:36 ) Chinese.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:13:39].

( 09:36 ) Yes.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:13:53].

( 09:36 ) I'm really proud [inaudible 00:14:06].

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:14:08].

( 09:36 ) I know what happens.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:14:16].

Announcer ( 09:36 ):

Two minutes until the briefing. Two minutes until the briefing.

Audience ( 09:36 ):

[inaudible 00:14:29] two.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:14:28].

( 09:36 ) Sorry.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:14:48].

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:14:49] the lights are on.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:14:52].

President Donald Trump ( 09:36 ):

Good morning.

Audience ( 09:36 ):

Good morning.

( 09:36 ) Good morning.

( 09:36 ) Good morning, Mr. President.

( 09:36 ) Morning.

( 09:36 ) [inaudible 00:15:14]

President Donald Trump ( 15:22 ):

Well, this was a big one, wasn't it? This was a big decision, an amazing decision, one that we're very happy about. This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch.

( 15:41 ) The Supreme Court has stopped the presidency itself. That's what they've done. And really it's been an amazing period of time this last hour. There are people elated all over the country. I've seen such happiness and spirit. Sometimes you don't see that, but this case is very important.

( 16:02 ) I was elected on a historic mandate, but in recent months, we've seen a handful of radical-left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they voted for in record numbers. That was a grave threat to democracy, frankly. And instead of merely ruling on the immediate cases before them, these judges have attempted to dictate the law for the entire nation. In practice, this meant that if any one of the nearly 700 federal judges disagreed with a policy of a duly-elected President of the United States, he or she could block that policy from going into effect, or at least delay it for many years, tie it up in the court system.

( 16:49 ) This was a colossal abuse of power which never occurred in American history prior to recent decades, and we've been hit with more nationwide injunctions than were issued in the entire 20th century together. Think of it more than the entire 20th century; me.

( 17:07 ) I'm grateful to the Supreme Court for stepping in and solving this very, very big and complex problem, and they've made it very simple. I want to thank Justice Barrett, who wrote the opinion brilliantly, as well as Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Thomas. Great people. Thanks for this decision, and thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis.

( 17:41 ) And some of the cases we're talking about would be ending birthright citizenship, which now comes to the fore. That was meant for the babies of slaves. It wasn't meant for people trying to scam the system and come into the country on a vacation. In fact, it was the same date, the exact same date,

President Donald Trump ( 18:00 ):

At the end of the Civil War, it was meant for the babies of slaves, and it's so clean and so obvious, but this lets us go there and finally win that case because hundreds of thousands of people are pouring into our country under birthright citizenship. And it wasn't meant for that reason. It was meant for the babies of slaves. So thanks to this decision, we can now properly file to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, including birthright citizenship, ending sanctuary city funding, suspending refugee resettlement, freezing unnecessary funding, stopping federal taxpayers from paying for transgender surgeries and numerous other priorities of the American people. We have so many of them. I have a whole list. I'm not going to bore you. And I'm going to have Pam get up and say a few words, but there's really… She can talk as long as she wants because this is a very important decision.

( 18:56 ) This is a decision that covers a tremendous amount of territory. But I want to just thank, again, the Supreme Court for this ruling. It's a giant. It's a giant. And they should be very proud and our country should be very proud of the Supreme Court today. And with that, I'd like you to listen to the words of Pam Bondi. She's an incredible attorney general. We're very proud of her. And as you know, Todd Blanche is with us, and we have so many others that worked on this case and other cases, and I think they're doing a great job. Pam, please say a few words.

Pam Bondi ( 19:35 ):

Thank you, president Trump. Thank you for fighting for all Americans. Americans are finally getting what they voted for. No longer will we have rogue judges striking down President Trump's policies across the entire nation. No longer. Today in the six three opinion, Justice Barrett correctly holds that the district court lacks authority to enter nationwide or universal injunctions. These lawless injunctions gave relief to everyone in the world instead of the parties before the court. As the Supreme Court held today, they turned district courts into the imperial judiciary. Active liberal justices, judges have used these injunctions to block virtually all of President Trump's policies. To put this in perspective, there are 94 federal judicial districts. Five of those districts throughout this country held 35 of the nationwide injunctions. Think about that, 94 districts. And 35 out of the 40 opinions with nationwide injunctions came from five liberal districts in this country. No longer, no longer.

( 20:56 ) These injunctions have blocked our policies from tariffs to military readiness, to immigration, to foreign affairs, fraud, abuse, and many other issues. The judges have tried to seize the executive branch's power and they cannot do that. No longer. No longer. And on immigration, on a side note, today marks 2,711 arrests on these terrorists and these gangs. Total arrests today with HSI investigations. And thank you Stephen Miller. Thank you to Homeland Security. Thank you to everyone working hand in hand with the FBI on all of these transnational gangs. TDA has been a huge terror to our country, as well as MS-13, as well as Sinaloa Cartels. No longer, no longer. These injunctions have allowed district court judges to be emperors. They vetoed all of President Trump's power and they cannot do that. This has been a bipartisan problem that has lasted five presidential terms, five different presidents, and it has ended today.

( 22:09 ) We will continue to fight for President Trump's policies. I want to thank the office of White House Council, Dave Warrington. You and your staff have been incredible. Our Solicitor General's office, John Sauer, Sarah Harris and Todd Blanche and Emil Bove. Todd's going to say a few words because we've had another major ruling today on transgender books and some other great wins that we've had. But no longer will they have this power in our country. It is the President's authority under his executive branch to do everything to fight for the American people. And he will continue to do that. That's why he was overwhelmingly elected. Thank you.

Speaker 2 ( 22:50 ):

Thank you. Today's a great day for the rule of law. It's a great day for the Justice Department and it's one that's been a long time coming and one that every American should've been waiting for with bated breath. And so I echo what the president said and Attorney General Bondi that the Supreme Court did a great thing today, not only for this administration, but for every American in this country. If not for the injunctions case, we would be here talking about another great decision that came down today. The trans books case, which restores parents' rights to decide their child's education. Seems like a basic idea, but it took the Supreme Court to set the record straight, and we thank them for that. And now that ruling allows parents to opt out of dangerous trans ideology and make the decisions for their children that they believe is correct. And so we thank the Supreme Court for that.

( 23:43 ) There's been multiple decisions over the past several weeks that just show why this nationwide injunction ban had to happen. What I mean by that is local district court judges issuing decisions that are clearly contrary to law just because they don't like the policy of President Trump. And when it gets to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court has to correct it. But that takes time. The attorney General thanked our lawyers, and I'll do it again. Our lawyers are working 24 hours a day, seven days a week to fight these injunctions and to emergency appeals emergency stays going back to the court judge asking them to change their view. And so their hard work is really paying off today. But over the past few weeks, we had a stay of an order that prevented DHS from moving aliens to a third country.

( 24:31 ) We had a stay of an order that stopped the Department of Defense from implementing military readiness, the EO that President Trump signed. We had another stay of an order forcing reinstatement of fired executive branch employees entirely within the President and Article II, his right to do. We had a stay of, as you all know, of numerous Doge cases. And again, every one of those stays requires a tremendous amount of work and effort by the lawyers and the parties involved. And they should be doing other work. They should be doing the work that the President and this administration demands and has a right to demand, and not fighting these local judges who don don't make decisions based on the law, they make decisions because they just simply don't agree with the administration's decision about a policy. And that's wrong. Thank you.

President Donald Trump ( 25:21 ):

Any questions? Yes, for Pam, please.

Pam Bondi ( 25:26 ):

Go ahead.

Speaker 3 ( 25:27 ):

Sure. Thank you Madam Attorney General. So as you know, the Supreme Court did not rule on the underlying constitutionality of the President's birthright citizenship order. So what is the plan now? Are you going to try to implement the EO just in states where there isn't a legal challenge?

Pam Bondi ( 25:46 ):

Yes. So birthright citizenship will be decided in October in the next session by the Supreme Court. Unless it comes down in the next few minutes. I guess it could come down. I think they're still deliberating right now on some cases. As you heard, we just got transgender books, which is a huge win. But most likely that will be decided in October in the next session. However, it indirectly impacts us because as you correctly pointed out, if there's a birthright citizenship case in Oregon, it will only affect the plaintiff in Oregon, not the entire country. So yes, it's indirectly, but that's pending litigation and we're waiting on that in the next term.

Speaker 3 ( 26:23 ):

And how concerned are you that the Supreme Court will come back and determine that the executive order is unconstitutional?

Pam Bondi ( 26:28 ):

Oh, we're very confident in the Supreme Court, but again, it's pending litigation, and that will directly be determined in October. But it indirectly impacts every case in this country. And we're thrilled with their decision today. Peter.

Speaker 4 ( 26:41 ):

Madam Attorney General, thank you for being here to take our questions. A couple of questions to the both of you. The EO had a 30-day grace period before it goes into effect. Is there any thought about trying to make it effective immediately within that period of time?

Pam Bondi ( 26:56 ):

We're going to follow the law. We are going to make those decisions and we're going to do what's right in the bounds of the law.

Speaker 4 ( 26:59 ):

And then the DOJ didn't ask the justices to rule on the merits of the birthright citizenship ban. Just for explanation purposes, why?

Pam Bondi ( 27:07 ):

Sure. Because that's going to come down in October in the… This was huge because it's indirectly impacted today. As I said, now it's case by case. Let me reiterate, of the 40 nationwide injunctions filed against this President against his executive authority as President of the United States, 35 of them came from Maryland, D.C, Massachusetts, California, Washington. That's crazy. These five districts. So yes, it indirectly impacts us. It will be a separate decision in October. Next question.

Speaker 5 ( 27:43 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. A question for you, sir. Do you believe this ends the power of the lower court judges to stop your agenda? Do you see this as a full green light for your agenda going forward?

President Donald Trump ( 27:53 ):

Well, you'd have to really speak to the lawyers about that, but this is really also a decision based on common sense. It didn't work the other way. It was a disaster where somebody from a certain location in a very liberal state or a liberal judge or a liberal group of judges could tie up a whole country for years because their decision would sometimes take years to overturn. We've overturned many of the decisions, but it would take years to do it. And we have to act quickly. When it comes to illegal immigration, we have murderers, killers, we have drug dealers. What they've allowed to come into our country should never be forgotten. It should never be forgotten what they've done to our country. And we have to be able to act very quickly and we're going to do that. Thank you.

Speaker 5 ( 28:37 ):

Amy Coney Barrett. Sir, I know that you praised her and her opinion here in this case. She has taken some heat though from some of your supporters who have labeled her weak, a squishy, a rattled law professor. What is your take on that? Do you think-

President Donald Trump ( 28:51 ):

I don't know about that. I just have great respect for her. I always have. And her decision was brilliantly written today, from all accounts. Yeah.

Speaker 6 ( 29:01 ):

What would you say to Americans who fear that this is more and more concentration of power in the White House and executive-

President Donald Trump ( 29:10 ):

Well, this way it brings back the constitution. This is what it's all about. And this is really the opposite of that. I mean, the question is fine, but it's the opposite. The constitution has been brought back.

Speaker 7 ( 29:22 ):

Thank you so much, President Trump. Illegal crossings in the border are zero now.

President Donald Trump ( 29:27 ):

Zero. Does everyone hear that? Zero.

Speaker 8 ( 29:30 ):

Trump 2028.

Speaker 7 ( 29:30 ):

Do you intend, President Trump-

President Donald Trump ( 29:35 ):

Who's that guy? I like him. I like him.

Speaker 8 ( 29:38 ):

[inaudible 00:29:39].

President Donald Trump ( 29:40 ):

He's working the cameras.

Speaker 7 ( 29:42 ):

With this new reality, President Trump, in the border, do you intend to engage personally with leaders from South America, not only Central America, in order to tackle this situation in a different way. And if you have a perspective of meeting some presence from South America, [inaudible 00:30:00], for example.

President Donald Trump ( 30:00 ):

Sure. I do that any way. I do that anyway. When you say as an example, not South America, but NATO over the weekend, they have great respect for our country now. They did things that nobody thought was possible. They took funding from 2% to 5%. Nobody thought they'd ever pay the 2%. And now they're paying the 5%. It's over a trillion dollars more a year. Think of that. A trillion dollars. Nobody thought that could happen. That's a different group of people, different countries. But we get along with a lot of countries. We are respected again. Our country, the US is respected again. It was not respected six months ago.

Speaker 9 ( 30:34 ):

Mr. President, you have a deadline coming up on trade in two weeks. Which countries-

President Donald Trump ( 30:42 ):

On what?

Speaker 9 ( 30:43 ):

On trade, on tariffs.

President Donald Trump ( 30:45 ):

Yeah.

Speaker 9 ( 30:45 ):

Which countries, if any, are close to agreements with the administration?

President Donald Trump ( 30:48 ):

Well, that's an interesting question. We've made a deal with China. We've made a deal with probably four or five different countries. With the UK, it was a great deal for both. And we're in the process of making some others. But ultimately, in fact, Scott is here and Howard Lutnick, these two guys have been doing an incredible job. And the people that work with them have been doing an incredible job. But we have 200 countries, you could say 200 countries plus who can't do that. So at a certain point, over the next week and a half or so, or maybe before, we're going to send out a letter. We talked to many of the countries and we're just going to tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States. And it's going to go very quickly. But some of the bigger countries, so India, I think we're going to reach a deal where we have the right to go in and trade.

( 31:34 ) Right now it's restricted. You can't walk in there, you can't even think about it. We're looking to get a full trade barrier dropping, which is unthinkable. And I'm not sure that that's going to happen. But as of this moment, we've agreed to that go into Indian trade. We're going to be trading in China. That's going to come a little bit down the road, but we're going to be trading in China. We have a lot of great things going and we're getting along with countries. But some will be disappointed because they're going to have to pay tariffs.

( 32:01 ) And we've taken in already hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. No inflation. The only problem we have is we have a fed guy that doesn't understand what's happening. And it would be great if they'd lower the rate because we'd be able to borrow a lot cheaper. Yeah, go ahead please. Why don't we keep it on this subject. This is such a big subject. You know what? Trade is so big, but this… I don't know. In a certain way, this might be bigger than trade. I think this is bigger than trade. Yes, please go ahead. Go ahead.

Speaker 10 ( 32:33 ):

Was just wondering though, if you could-

President Donald Trump ( 32:34 ):

Go ahead.

Speaker 10 ( 32:35 ):

Sir, on the transgender ruling, the Supreme Court ruling that parents with religious objections can pull their kids out of public school lessons that use LGBTQ materials. Pam brought it up. Your reaction to that ruling today, sir?

President Donald Trump ( 32:47 ):

I think the ruling was a great ruling and I think it's a great ruling for parents. It's really a ruling for parents. They lost control of the schools. They lost control of their child. And this is a tremendous victory for parents. And I'm not surprised by it, but I am surprised that it went this far. It took us to bring life back to normal. It's parental and I kept saying, we will give you back your parental rights. They were taken away and this is a tremendous victory for parents. Yeah.

Speaker 1 ( 33:18 ):

Mr. President, if you look at back at the last week, it's been extraordinary in terms of the action in the Middle East. You were at the Hague. I'm wondering how-

President Donald Trump ( 33:27 ):

Been a hell of a week, hasn't it?

Speaker 1 ( 33:27 ):

I'm wondering now if you believe that Iran-

President Donald Trump ( 33:29 ):

It's been some week.

Speaker 1 ( 33:30 ):

I'm wondering now, sir, if you believe that Iran has given up its long history of ambitions with nuclear weapons or what you would like to see from them to prove that they do. And what type of meetings is your administration looking for next week with Iran?

President Donald Trump ( 33:45 ):

So Iran wants to meet. As you know, their sites were obliterated. Their very evil nuclear sites. Now has been proven we had some fake news for a little while. The same people that covered the Hunter Biden laptop was from Russia. The same people that did three or four other, Russia, Russia, Russia hoax.

Speaker 1 ( 34:04 ):

But on their ambition-

President Donald Trump ( 34:04 ):

No, no, wait, wait, just listen. They came up with something that delayed the credit that our great pilots and these Great America… I mean, they want talent that was… And they hit it right down in the spot, 52,000 feet. Think of this dark, no moon, you couldn't see a thing. And they hit the refrigerator door, as they say. That's the size of a target. And overwhelmingly, and it's amazing what was done. We're the only ones that could've done it. And we took out two of the other sites also, in addition to that. We finished them off. That was a very evil intention. And again, time will tell, but I don't believe that they're going to go back into nuclear anytime soon. They spent over a trillion dollars on nuclear and they never got it together.

( 34:53 ) And nothing was moved from the site, by the way. To do that is very dangerous. It's very, very heavy material. Those cars were most likely the cars of Masons because they were pouring concrete at the top, at the hatch. As you know, the hatch going into the nuclear site. They wanted to reinforce it. And they had some masons there pouring concrete. By the way that concrete was obliterated. It hit exactly at the concrete. I don't think it had a chance to dry. But everything's down there. It's under millions of tons of rock. Please. Please.

Speaker 11 ( 35:29 ):

Your administration has said that El Salvador is one of the safest countries in the hemisphere. So why haven't you yet canceled temporary protective status for that country? Was it part of the deal?

President Donald Trump ( 35:38 ):

Well, we'll take a look. We've had a great relationship with El Salvador. They have a fantastic leader. They built a massive prison system and I don't know exactly why, but it's a hell of a system. And we bring people there and when they go there, they don't get out. And frankly, when they're here, they have to go there. They become very nice people. They become very nice people.

President Donald Trump ( 36:00 ):

Well, it's a tough system, but it's a brilliant system and it's a system done by a very, very good leader. We'll talk about El Salvador. A lot of respect.

Speaker 12 ( 36:08 ):

Mr. President.

Speaker 13 ( 36:08 ):

Mr. President.

Speaker 14 ( 36:08 ):

Mr. President.

President Donald Trump ( 36:09 ):

Yeah, please.

Speaker 15 ( 36:13 ):

Thank you. Thank you. A question for you and then a question for the Attorney General. As you go into negotiations and talks with Iran, are you demanding not only that there would be no uranium production inside of Iran, but also that Iran would turn over all existing stockpiles of uranium?

President Donald Trump ( 36:27 ):

Well, we're a little early for that, but something like that, yeah, we'll do something like that. Let me say that, I've been saying for 25 years, even as a civilian, you cannot let them have a nuclear weapon, and that's what happened. It's been obliterated. It would be years before they could ever get going, and I really think it's probably the last thing. They have to recover from, a hell of a tough war.

Speaker 15 ( 36:50 ):

Would you also be demanding that the IAEA have full rights to inspect in Iran-

President Donald Trump ( 36:55 ):

Or somebody, yeah. Or somebody that we respect, including ourselves.

Speaker 15 ( 36:59 ):

And a question for both the President and the Attorney General. Under birthright citizenship, if this is implemented, who would be tasked with actually vetting citizenship? And would this be a situation where you have nurses and doctors checking for citizenship of parents or … ?

Pam Bondi ( 37:15 ):

This is all pending litigation. It's going to be decided in October by the Supreme Court and we'll discuss that after the litigation.

Speaker 15 ( 37:23 ):

If you have an undocumented baby, would that baby then be an enforcement priority?

Pam Bondi ( 37:29 ):

The violent criminals in our country are the priority now. Let me put it in perspective. Today marked the 2711th arrest in our country of TDA members, just TDA. Everyone in this room agrees they're one of the most violent criminal organizations in the world. And the Biden administration let them walk into our country, walk into our country for the last four years. 2,711 of them today have been arrested in our country. That is the priority of Donald Trump. That is the priority of this country, of Homeland Security, of all of our lawyers, of FBI. That's the priority. That will be discussed in October when the Supreme Court hopefully rules in our favor, and we're very confident of that.

( 38:17 ) But you should all feel safer now that President Trump can deport all of these gangs and not one district court judge can think they're an emperor over this administration, his executive powers and why the people of the United States elected him.

President Donald Trump ( 38:35 ):

I just might add one thing. They used birthright citizenship, some of the worst people, some of the cartels to get people into our country, just so you know. And again, I say if you look at the end of the Civil War, the 1800s, it was a very turbulent time. If you take the end day, was it 1869 or whatever, but you take that exact day, that's when the case was filed and the case ended shortly thereafter. This had to do with the babies of slaves, very, very obviously, and I think we're going to win people. I don't think they went about discussing it right. I came along and we looked and we said, "Wait a minute, this is wrong. We've been looking at birthright citizenship wrong for years."

( 39:16 ) But they've used it, the cartels have used birthright citizenship to get very bad people in. And what Pam's doing and what Todd and everybody else, what they're doing at DOJ and all over FBI, ICE, Border Patrol, these are incredible people. They're trying to keep our country safe and they don't want to have people come in. This is just another way that they get illegal immigrants into our country and in some cases very, very bad ones. Go ahead.

Speaker 16 ( 39:41 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. On your tax bill, if I could for a moment, senators are racing to rewrite parts of it right now after the Senate parliamentarian ruled that sections of it were outside of the process that they're using to get this through. Do you think that senators should respect the decisions of the parliamentarian and what have you personally done in the last 48 hours to try and get Republican senators who are against the bill to a yes?

President Donald Trump ( 40:07 ):

Well, look, it's a great bill. It's a massive tax cut. If it's not approved, your taxes will go up by 68%. Think of that, 68, a record, the highest in the history. The Democrats won't approve it only because politically it's so good for the Republicans. The Democrats aren't approving it.

( 40:24 ) But think of what they're not approving. They're not approving border security. We've done a great job at the border, but we have to add some war. We have to do various things. We have no money for that. We have no money for the border. We have no money for so many things. But if the Democrats … It would be interesting to see if we get any Democrat votes. We should. If I were a Democrat, I would absolutely, maybe Fetterman 'cause he seems to be the most sensible one lately, if I were a Democrat, I would vote for this bill all day long because it's tax cuts and so many other things that are common sense. They're basic things.

( 40:58 ) I think they're doing fine. The parliamentarian has been a little difficult and I would say that I disagree with the parliamentarian on some things and on other ways he's been fine, but we'll have to see. It's a big issue.

( 41:12 ) I will tell you this. If that bill doesn't pass, the country will get a 68, 68% tax increase. So think of this, you're a Democrat and you vote against it. That means you're voting in favor because essentially you're voting in favor the largest tax hike in the history of our country, and you can't do that. In addition, we're cutting costs by $1.7 trillion and it won't affect anybody. It's just fraud, waste and abuse.

Speaker 17 ( 41:39 ):

Mr. President.

Speaker 18 ( 41:41 ):

Mr. President.

Speaker 19 ( 41:43 ):

Mr. President, a leading global economist, just did a 180 and says, your tariff plan may have outsmarted everybody with it. What is your message?

President Donald Trump ( 41:53 ):

I love this question. This is the favorite. This is the best question I've ever been asked 'cause I've been going through abuse for years on this.

Speaker 19 ( 42:00 ):

But Mr. President-

President Donald Trump ( 42:00 ):

Because as you know, we're taking in hundreds of billions of dollars, no inflation whatsoever.

Speaker 19 ( 42:08 ):

But Mr. President, what is your message to critics who think your tariff-plan will cause a recession?

President Donald Trump ( 42:13 ):

I think they should go back to business school. It's so obvious. It's so obvious. I mean, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars from China and a lot of other countries. We took in … I had a call from somebody in the house and high official. "Sir, we have a problem. We don't know what to do. The books are a mess." I said, "What do you mean by the books?" "The books, the money, the money coming in. It's so terrible."

( 42:37 ) I figured, "Oh boy, what's this? I don't like this question." I said, "So what seems … ?" "There's so much money coming in and there must be some kind of an accounting mistake 'cause we have hundreds of billions of dollars more money than we thought." I said, "Do me a favor. Go check the gear. Call me back. You have to call me back. Check the tariff column."

( 42:57 ) He calls me back two hours later, says, "You're right. We took in 88 billion in tariffs." They have so much money coming in. But more important than the money coming in, we have companies coming in, factories coming in, auto plants being built. AI is being built here instead of being built all over Europe and Asia. We have all of it. We have over $15 trillion just about, Scott. I think we're right about that at that number. We went to Saudi Arabia, we went to Qatar, we went to UAE. Very smart people, very smart leaders, great leaders, and we took in 5.1 trillion just there without the tariffs.

( 43:33 ) I mean they also like the thing called November 5th, November 6th and November 7th. That was a very good little period of time. It's called the presidential election. You used to have one day election. Now you have it go over it, but even if you just took that little period, 'cause it was pretty obvious it was going to be a landslide and they liked that, but they loved the tariffs.

( 43:53 ) I had Texas Instruments come in the other day, big company, and he said, "We're putting in $60 billion into new plants and new equipment, new everything. Sir, you're going to keep the tariffs, aren't you?" Because whoever took the tariffs off. And we are going to absolutely keep it, and they're worried that somebody like this communist from New York someday gets elected. I can't believe that's happening. That's a terrible thing for our country, by the way. He's a communist. We're going to go to a communistic … That's so bad for New York. But the rest of the country's revolting against it. But if somebody got elected, they're afraid that if this was taken off. Well, we're going to guarantee it's never going to be taken off. And again, we're taking in hundred, think of this, hundreds of billions of dollars, and they were all confused because they've never seen this before.

( 44:40 ) It's always the other way. We don't have enough money. So much money is coming in at levels that nobody's ever seen, but most importantly, we have factories being built, car plants being built, companies moving to our country like never before. If you look at 15 trillion, and that's only in a few months, I haven't been here that long. Presidents like the last one was a disaster. He's the worst president in the history of our country by the way. What he did on our border can never ever be forgotten. To me, that's the worst of all the things, and he's done some terrible things, grossly incompetent. Nobody knew it was him 'cause I don't think it was him. I think it was whoever was controlling the auto pen.

( 45:18 ) But our country is doing great, and those leaders and other leaders, I just left as you know, a large group of the most highly respected people, and that includes big countries.

( 45:31 ) When you look at Germany and France and Spain, although Spain didn't come through, but they will. By the way, guaranteed they will. That was the only country that sort of tried to hold back on putting up the money, but just so you know, they said, "It's unbelievable what's happened to the USA. You were a dead country. We didn't respect the country, the leader. You were dead as a doornail." One said to me, "You went from being a dead country. You are right now the hottest country anywhere in the world. The whole world is talking about the USA and everybody wants a part of it." And they're pouring into our country. And you're going to see those numbers. Thank you for that question.

( 46:17 ) Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead, please.

Speaker 20 ( 46:17 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question about trade. Secretary Bessent has said that he hopes tariff deals with major partners will be done by Labor Day. So if some deals are not done by your July 9th deadline, will some countries' tariffs go back up or will they stay where they are?

President Donald Trump ( 46:33 ):

Yeah, well, there's some countries that are used to ripping us off, to be honest with you, and I don't want to name them, but you sort of can name them. And they're so used to just getting, taking billions and billions of … Look, we had a trade deficit of more than a trillion dollars, think of it, a trillion, a trade deficit. That's because nobody cared. Nobody. We cared a lot when I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariff. We had the greatest economy in history up until now. I think we're going to blow it away. But during my time, and especially prior to COVID, we were the greatest economy in the history of our country. I think we're going to blow it away now based on the kind of numbers that we're seeing.

( 47:15 ) But some countries are very angry because they've been ripping us off for years. They've been making billions and billions of dollars. There was nobody to negotiate with. They could do whatever they want. They charge us tariffs, by the way, at numbers that we've never seen before, and we ended up losing much more than a trillion dollars a year, a trillion dollars a year on trade. And now they are being met with a force that's far greater than them and they don't like it, so they're upset. Because instead of making $5 billion, they're going to break even or they'll make a little bit, I want to be nice. They'll make a little bit or we'll make a little bit. It's a big difference. Yeah. Please go head. Red. Red dress.

Speaker 21 ( 47:58 ):

On the 2020 election, is there any more information on the special prosecutor? So many Americans still have questions about the 2020 election. And speaking of rogue judges, would you consider appointing somebody at DOJ maybe to investigate the judges that allowed for the political persecution of you, your family, and your supporters during the Biden administration?

President Donald Trump ( 48:17 ):

I love you. Who are you?

Speaker 21 ( 48:19 ):

I'm Cara from LindellTV.

President Donald Trump ( 48:20 ):

Well, that's just a very nice question. And it's not a setup. I have no idea who you are, but I appreciate that question. All I can say is we're not here for that. I hope so. I hope they're doing a thing because that election was rigged and stolen and we can't allow that to happen. A lot of people tell me, "Sir, you just won the greatest election in the history of our country. You won at numbers that … " I won all seven swing states, won the popular vote, won everything. "Sir, go on with your life." And many people that say that, good people, friends of mine. Then you have people that say that same thing, go on with your life, but you have to find out what happened because you can't let that happen again.

( 49:02 ) Look at what this lunatic did. Look at what he did. He opened our borders to people that were murderers, 11,888 to be exact, murders. And we've captured many of those murderers and we're bringing them back or some of them are so dangerous that we don't even want to bring them back. We're afraid they're going to try and come back in. But he allowed people to come into this country. People from mental institutions, insane asylums. That's a mental institution on steroids. People from mental institutions, gang members, drug dealers, people, oh, jails being emptied out into our country. Venezuela emptied out almost its entire prison population into our country.

( 49:45 ) But I don't want to blame them. Many countries have done that. The Congo, we have a great press conference coming up later, and it's the Congo and Rwanda. They were fighting for years and it was machetes. It was vicious. It was as vicious people's heads being chopped off. And I have a man who's very good in that part of the world, very smart, and put them together and we're signing a peace treaty today. First time in many years they're going to have peace, and it's a big deal.

( 50:17 ) We talk about Russia and we're going to work. We're working that one. President Putin called up and he said, "I'd love to help you with Iran." I said, "Do me a favor. I'll handle Iran. Help me with Russia. We got to get that one settled," and I think something's going to happen there. But we did, we did some great work.

( 50:36 ) India and Pakistan, that was going to be maybe nuclear. We did that. We did a lot of work. I don't know if there's ever been a president that's done much more. Serbia, Kosovo, who's going to go at it, going to be a big war. I said, "You go at it. There's no trade with the United States." They said, "Well, maybe we won't go at it." That's what happened with India and Pakistan. I was negotiating with both of them and I said to Scott, I said to Howard, "Cancel all deals with India and Pakistan. They're not trading with us because they're in a war." They called back, "What do we do?" I said, "Look, you want to have trade with the United States. It's great. But you want to go and start using nuclear weapons on each other, we're not going to allow that." And they both agreed. Both have great leaders. They both agreed not to do it. So we did a lot, but I appreciate that question.

Speaker 22 ( 51:34 ):

Thank you so much you. Thank you, Mr. President.

President Donald Trump ( 51:34 ):

You with orange.

Speaker 22 ( 51:35 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. I was just speaking with Senator Ron Johnson on the one big beautiful bill and he says he really wants to get to yes for you and get this accomplished.

President Donald Trump ( 51:44 ):

He does. He's a good man.

Speaker 22 ( 51:44 ):

But he also said that he needs more time and he is not certain that the July 4th deadline is possible-

President Donald Trump ( 51:48 ):

Well, then he's not such a good man-

Speaker 22 ( 51:49 ):

Because there's too much work to do. How important-

President Donald Trump ( 51:50 ):

No, he's a good man. Ron Johnson is doing a good job. He's very committed. Every Republican senator is committed. And you could have a couple of grand standards in all fairness. You could have somebody else. And it's very dangerous because our country would go from being the most successful country in the world to who knows what happens with a 68%, think of it, 68% tax increase. That was given by the Democrats because they like high taxes. I don't know what happened.

( 52:17 ) All my life, I'd grow up and I'd watch politicians talking. I'd say, "Oh, that's fun." And they were always saying, "We will cut your taxes. We will cut your … " I never heard they say, "We will raise your taxes." And they elect people like this guy in New York that maybe has a chance. I find it hard to believe, but he maybe has a chance. They want to raise your taxes. So they want to see a 68% tax increase. That's more money than anybody could afford. You'd go into a depression if that ever happened, so I think there's a lot of pressure to get that approved.

Speaker 22 ( 52:55 ):

How important is the July 4th deadline to you if-

President Donald Trump ( 52:56 ):

It's important. It's not the end all. It can go longer. But we'd like to get it done by that time if possible. And look, we have a lot of very committed people and they feel very strongly about a subject, subjects that you're not even thinking about that are important to Republicans. The problem we have is that it's a great bill, it's a popular bill, but we get no Democrats only because they don't want to vote for Trump. If that bill was their bill, oh, they would be so happy. It's so great for our military, it's great for everything. And they would normally vote, but because their hatred of Trump, they have Trump derangement syndrome at levels never seen before. And instead of voting for a tax cut, they're voting for a tax increase of 68%. They're voting to destroy social security, destroy Medicare and destroy Medicaid, and we're voting to make them perfect and to make them better, make them stronger and better. They're going to destroy Medicaid and they're going to destroy Medicare and social security will follow. If you vote for the Democrats, you are dead on those three

Speaker 24 ( 53:59 ):

Thank …

President Donald Trump ( 54:00 ):

… everything.

Speaker 25 ( 54:03 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. On a related subject, many Democrats have said that they are not going to support crypto bills in Congress only because of you and your family's personal crypto ventures. And these votes are in some cases needed to pass. Are you open to the idea of pulling away from your personal crypto ventures just for the next few years, if that helps get these crypto bills passed in the next few months?

President Donald Trump ( 54:25 ):

Yeah. Well, it's a very funny thing, crypto. So I became a fan of crypto, and to me it's an industry. I view it as an industry, and I'm president. And if we didn't have it, China would or somebody else would, but most likely China. China would love to. And we've dominated that industry. It's a big industry, by the way. In fact, when the stock market went down recently, crypto and Bitcoin and all of that went down much less than anybody else as a group. And we've created a very powerful industry, and that's much more important than anything that we invest in. We invest in it, but really that was an industry that wasn't doing particularly well. I got involved with it a couple of years ago, and before the second term. I got involved before I decided to run. I only decided to run because I saw what was happening, and Biden was incompetent, and the administration was crooked and incompetent. And I was in Bitcoin then, not knowing if I was going to do it a third time.

( 55:21 ) So it's become amazing. I mean, the jobs that it producers. And I notice more and more you pay in Bitcoin, I mean, people are saying it takes a lot of pressure off the dollar and it's a great thing for our country. So I don't care about investing. I have kids and they invest in different things, they do believe in it. But I'm president, and what I did do there is build an industry that's very important. And if we didn't have it, China would.

( 55:48 ) Okay. Go ahead. With the glasses, gentleman, go ahead, please.

Speaker 26 ( 55:53 ):

Me?

President Donald Trump ( 55:53 ):

Go ahead.

Speaker 26 ( 55:54 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. So are you going to cut funds in the sanctuary states? Like for instance, California, they keep supporting illegal immigration, and then these people work under the table.

President Donald Trump ( 56:04 ):

Yeah, we're giving them a hard time.

Speaker 26 ( 56:05 ):

And also a foreign policy question-

President Donald Trump ( 56:08 ):

They don't have a governor in California. They have a man that wants to give away everything to people that nobody's seen before. If we didn't go into Los Angeles with the military, which did a fantastic job, but if we didn't go into Los Angeles bringing in the National Guard, I would've brought the military if it was necessary, because you have to. We have the right to, that was another thing upheld by the Supreme Court. But if we didn't go in with the National Guard and be strong and tough, you wouldn't maybe have a Los Angeles. It would be like the rest of California, the rest of Los Angeles. They lost 25,000 houses in a fire. They should have lost none.

( 56:47 ) I sent the water down. I had to break into their water supply because they just refused to do it. They're crazy. There's something wrong with them. They have plenty of water. They don't have droughts or anything. We let it come down from the Pacific Northwest. They routed all the water out into the Pacific Ocean for environmental reasons. And now you have 25,000 houses, none of which would've burned down if you had the water. They didn't have water. They didn't have water for the fire pumps, they didn't have water in the sprinkler systems that people put in.

( 57:14 ) So the answer is, we're going to work with governors, we're going to work with radical left Democrats and Democrats, and we're going to make it good for everybody. We'll have to stop the crime. In the case of the cities, I think I can say just about all cities with heavy crime are run by Democrats.

( 57:36 ) Go ahead.

Speaker X ( 57:36 ):

[inaudible 00:57:40]

President Donald Trump ( 57:40 ):

Yeah, with the glasses. Go ahead.

Speaker 27 ( 57:40 ):

I'm with [inaudible 00:57:41] International.

President Donald Trump ( 57:41 ):

Go ahead, yes. Yeah, go. No, no, the man behind you. Yeah, please.

Anthony Merchak ( 57:45 ):

President Trump, Anthony Merchak from MTV in Lebanon. I want to ask you, regarding the threats posed by Iran's allies and proxies operating in the US, they were threatening your life, so what do you say about that? And regarding Lebanon, because Hezbollah is as well part of Iran's allies, if there is any timeframe in Lebanon regarding disarming Hezbollah in Lebanon?

President Donald Trump ( 58:07 ):

Yeah. Lebanon is a great place with brilliant people. It was known for the professors and doctors, and had an incredible history, and hopefully we can bring it back again. I just appointed a friend of mine who is Lebanese, and I didn't know he was Lebanese. I've known him for 20 years. Very, very successful man. And I just appointed him. And I said, "Why would you want that?" He said, "Because I was born there, I was raised there, I love it. I love it so much." I said, "You know, it's very dangerous going to Lebanon as ambassador." And he said, "That's what they say, but I don't care about danger." I mean, this is a guy that is a very big business guy. He wants to give up his whole life to go to Lebanon because he believes in it so much. We're with Lebanon all the way. We'll try and straighten it out.

Anthony Merchak ( 58:52 ):

But they are threatening your life as well, so what actions do you plan to take?

President Donald Trump ( 58:55 ):

Threatened my life, yeah, they have threatened. I get that throbbing feeling every once in a while, get that throbbing feeling. But you know what? That's okay. This is a dangerous business. What I do is a dangerous business. I tell the story of the car companies and different people in different professions. You have race car drivers as an example, 1/10 of 1% die, bull riders, 1/10 of 1%. That's not a lot, but it's people, die. When you're president, it's about 5%. If somebody would've told me that, maybe I wouldn't have run. Okay. This is a very dangerous profession.

( 59:38 ) Yeah, please.

Speaker X ( 59:39 ):

[inaudible 00:59:41]

President Donald Trump ( 59:41 ):

By the way, so many questions, should we keep this going, Pam?

Speaker X ( 59:43 ):

[inaudible 00:59:48]

President Donald Trump ( 59:48 ):

This is the opposite of Biden. Biden would take a half a question and he'd leave without answering it. Go ahead. You tell me when it gets boring, okay.

Speaker 28 ( 01:00:00 ):

On Iran, if Iran-

President Donald Trump ( 01:00:02 ):

Are you from Iran?

Speaker 28 ( 01:00:04 ):

No, I'm not from Iran, I'm from the UK. But if the intelligence reports conclude that Iran can enrich uranium to a level that concerns you, would you consider bombing the country again?

President Donald Trump ( 01:00:17 ):

Sure. Without question. Absolutely.

Speaker 28 ( 01:00:17 ):

And have you had any conversations-

President Donald Trump ( 01:00:20 ):

Turned out to be unbelievable. But our incredible flyers and our, I call them the shots, these guys are unbelievable. Think, from 52,000 feet they hit the equivalent of a refrigerator door. They actually hit it right in the center, so it's much smaller than that. And just bomb after bomb, going deeper, deeper, blowing up. Incredible, incredible thing.

( 01:00:43 ) I don't know if you heard the general, he was very impressive, Razin Caine. He's the one that beat ISIS for me. And he did it in a matter of weeks. And I was told it was going to take four or five years. And when I got this job, I always said, if I get this job, I'm going to put that guy as the head of the Joint Chiefs of staff. And Dan Caine, when I heard his name was Razin, his nickname is Razin Caine, I said, "You got to be kidding." So I liked him right from the beginning. But he knocked out ISIS in a time that nobody ever thought possible. And when this attack was completed and so successful, I said, "Now I know how you knocked out ISIS so quickly."

( 01:01:20 ) But we have the best people, we have the best equipment in the world. I rebuilt the military during my four years, during my other term. We have the best equipment in the world. The problem is we gave away a lot of it, but small, relatively speaking. We gave a lot of it away to Afghanistan. Shouldn't have happened. That just shows how incompetent they were. They gave all that equipment away, billions and billions of dollars worth. Shouldn't have happened. But that was small compared to what we have. Now we have a great military with great people. Okay.

( 01:01:48 ) Yeah, please.

Speaker 29 ( 01:01:52 ):

Mr. President, congratulations. A couple of very different questions. One is, Rwanda, 1994. You grew up in New York. We all knew how horrific those attacks were. Congratulations on that treaty. There are talks that perhaps-

President Donald Trump ( 01:02:05 ):

That's going to take place today at three o'clock in the Oval Office. We're going to have a signing with Rwanda and the Congo.

Speaker 29 ( 01:02:10 ):

I have a follow-up.

President Donald Trump ( 01:02:11 ):

So I'm a little out of my league in that one because I didn't know too much about it. I knew one thing, they were going at it for many years, and with machetes. It is one of the worst wars that anyone's ever seen. And I just happened to have somebody that was able to get it settled. I mean, just a brilliant person who is very comfortable in that part of the world. It's a very dangerous part of the world. I said, "Are you uncomfortable there? People are being killed. Schoolchildren are being raided and killed, and I don't even want to say how, but as viciously as I've ever heard. Are you uncomfortable?" "No. That's the part of the world that I know." Very comfortable. Was able to get them together and sell it.

( 01:02:52 ) And not only that, we're getting for the United States a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo as part of it. They're so honored to be here. They never thought they'd be coming to… Look, this is a very tough part of the world. They never thought, they were just telling me they never thought they'd ever be coming to the White House, and they're so honored. And so we're going to give them a great big reception. But that's after many years of fighting. It's a great thing. That's at three o'clock, I believe.

Speaker 30 ( 01:03:19 ):

Sir, are you concerned at all about secret nuclear sites in Iran? Can you talk about maybe just-

President Donald Trump ( 01:03:24 ):

Secret nuclear sites?

Speaker 30 ( 01:03:25 ):

Yes. That there might be some that [inaudible 01:03:27]-

President Donald Trump ( 01:03:26 ):

Not really. Can I tell you? They're exhausted. And Israel's exhausted too. And I dealt with both of them, and they both wanted it settled, both of them. And we did a great job. But they're exhausted. The last thing they're thinking about right now is nuclear. You know what they're thinking of? They're thinking about tomorrow, trying to live. It's such a mess. It's such a mess. The place was bombed to hell. And no, I'm not worried about it at all. And I'm putting out a little statement. I'm going to respond to the Ayatollah's statement yesterday that, "We won the war." Oh God, won the war. And I said, "Look, you're a man of great faith. A man who's highly respected in this country. You have to tell the truth. You got beat to hell." And Israel was beat up too. They were both beat up, and it was a great time to end it. It was quick. They got the hate out there. There was a lot of hate. A lot of hate. It would be great if they didn't have that hate. But the last thing they're thinking about is nuclear weapons right now.

( 01:04:33 ) Please.

Iris Tao ( 01:04:38 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. Iris Tao with NTD research [inaudible 01:04:41] media with The Epoch Times.

President Donald Trump ( 01:04:42 ):

Good.

Iris Tao ( 01:04:42 ):

Thank you so much for doing this. It's very refreshing for all of us here I believe in this room.

President Donald Trump ( 01:04:46 ):

It's a good group. It's refreshing?

Iris Tao ( 01:04:47 ):

Very refreshing.

President Donald Trump ( 01:04:48 ):

Probably.

Iris Tao ( 01:04:48 ):

Yes. We have this for the past-

President Donald Trump ( 01:04:51 ):

I understand what you mean.

Speaker X ( 01:04:52 ):

Four years.

Iris Tao ( 01:04:52 ):

So thank you so much for coming out here to-

President Donald Trump ( 01:04:54 ):

Other than Caroline's done a great job, right?

Iris Tao ( 01:04:55 ):

Yes.

President Donald Trump ( 01:04:56 ):

You're referring to the past administration, not to Caroline, right?

Iris Tao ( 01:05:00 ):

Yes, yes. Yes. Back to the ruling today, if you don't mind. So you have always talked about winning for the American people. How do you think today's ruling will enable you to further deliver for American families and workers across the country, not only when it comes to immigration, but also when it comes to trade, energy? What actions are most eager to move forward with now?

President Donald Trump ( 01:05:18 ):

Well, I think taking power away from these absolutely crazy, radical left judges is a tremendous… This is such a big day. This is such a big day. It's sort of sad because we're doing the signing at three o'clock, and this may very well dominate the signing of a big war that was going on and really affecting the continent of… Think of it, the entire continent of Africa was being affected, and we're settling that war today. And this will probably be your headline. But this is a very big moment, and it gives power back to people that should have it, including Congress, including the presidency. And it only takes bad power away from judges. It takes bad power, sick power, and unfair power. This is a very monumental decision.

( 01:06:09 ) Yeah, please.

Speaker 31 ( 01:06:10 ):

Mr. President, thanks very much. On July 9th, is that July 9th date set for tariffs to snap back?

President Donald Trump ( 01:06:18 ):

No.

Speaker 31 ( 01:06:18 ):

Or could there be a-

President Donald Trump ( 01:06:19 ):

We can do whatever we want. We could extend it, we could make it shorter. I'd like to make it shorter. I'd like to just send letters out to everybody, "Congratulations, you're paying 25%." He doesn't want… He's a much nicer person than I am.

( 01:06:32 ) Go ahead, you can finish it up.

Speaker 32 ( 01:06:37 ):

Who are you considering for the Federal Reserve then? And are you speeding up that process? I see secretary-

President Donald Trump ( 01:06:41 ):

Oh, he's terrible. He's terrible. I mean, I have a list of things. We're like 38 on the list. Cameroon and different places are paying the same as us. Because you have somebody sets a rate at 4% or 4.5% percent, it's hard to go out and say we should be paying 1% when you have your so-called experts doing that. And the sad part is, as per the question that you asked about tariffs, we've had the tariffs, and we have less inflation than we had before. What we have is a hell of a lot more money, a hell of a lot more income. And we shouldn't be paying a rate like that.

( 01:07:19 ) In other words, when we pay a rate… I'll tell you, each point is the equivalent of $300 billion. So if we had it down three points… Because I think we should be at 1. You have Switzerland is at point 0.25, in other words, 25% of 1%. And they're the number one right now. But we should be the number one. And soon you're going to have, I believe, I think you're going to have where the people will pay, like we had a few years ago where you put up money, you loan money, and actually, instead of paying, you get paid. I love that. I don't know if it's any good, but I love it where you put up money and you get paid.

( 01:08:01 ) But we should be in a category… So we should be at the top of the list, not toward the bottom of the list. But we have a man who's not a smart man, and he probably has Trump derangement syndrome, and he's just not a smart person. What he's doing though, he's hurting us for years to come, because if we borrow money at two points higher than we should be paying, that's $600 billion. Would you say those numbers are about right, Scott? So two points would be about 600 , actually more than that, but about $600 billion, all because the guy doesn't want to lower the rates.

( 01:08:34 ) He's doing the service a very… And then he goes up, talks about, "I'd like to see costs come down." He gets up and he does his little thing for five minutes, then he goes out and he goes back to the beach. He goes, "I'd like to see costs come down." Well, he could lower the interest cost by 900 billion a year. All he has to do is lower rates. And everybody's saying, I was watching some of the business shows today, and they're saying, "Trump's right, he should really be cutting. The country's doing well. We have no inflation." Now, despite him, we're doing great. But if we got the rates down, we would be a rocket ship.

( 01:09:08 ) So I think that'll be it. And I just want to thank everybody. This is a really big day. We've had a big week. We've had a big week. We've had a lot of victories this week. NATO was a tremendous victory. The war was a tremendous… Look, we were talking about this for 30 years, about Iran being nuclear. And all I said is it will not be nuclear, and it's not going to be nuclear. And then I want to give credit to a lot of people, most importantly to our great military. Boy, they put out that fire. Once that happened, once those bombs got dropped, that war was over. That war was over. But I just want to compliment them. Incredible. The general and all of his generals. Pete Hegseth was great. They were all…

( 01:09:53 ) And now I want to compliment Pam. A lot of genius went into this. People, if you don't say it exactly right, if the Supreme Court doesn't get it because it's incorrectly spoken about… And that happens. A lot of cases are lost because they don't say the right words. She's going to go down as a great attorney general. I may change my mind about that. I don't know. Maybe someday I'll have call and say, "I was only kidding." She's going to go down as a great attorney general. This was a tremendous win. And we've had tremendous wins, but this was a tremendous win today. So I just want to congratulate you and Todd and your whole staff, very brilliant people. And we can't forget John Sauer.

Pam Bondi ( 01:10:32 ):

That's right, John Sauer.

President Donald Trump ( 01:10:35 ):

There's a medical emergency within his family, so he's taking care of that, and we said, "Absolutely." So I just want to thank everybody very much. Thank you.

Speaker X ( 01:10:42 ):
