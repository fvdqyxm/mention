Speaker 4 ( 19:00 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of the Republic of India.

Donald Trump ( 19:00 ):

Thank you very much, please. A great honor. I'm thrilled to welcome the Prime Minister of India, my friend, Narendra Modi, back to The White House, and we spent a lot of time here and a lot of time in India and he's a very special man. Prime Minister, it is a pleasure to extend to you the same hospitalality that you showed Melania and myself to your beautiful country five years ago. It's hard to believe so long ago, and it seemed like yesterday. It was beautiful. We opened a cricket stadium, 129,000 seats. The largest stadium in the world and it was an incredible period of time. There is truly a special bond between the United States and India, the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy and I believe the world's largest country in terms of the numbers of people. And today, the Prime Minister and I are announcing a framework to strengthen those ties even further economically. And the US-India Compact with the 21st century is a historic initiative that will deepen every aspect of our partnership and our friendship.

( 20:13 ) Starting this year, we'll be increasing military sales to India by many billions of dollars. We're also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 Stealth fighters. In 2017, my administration revived and reinvigorated the Quad Security Partnership. In our meeting today, the Prime Minister and I reaffirmed that strong cooperation among the United States, India, Australia, and Japan and it's crucial really to maintain peace and prosperity, tranquility even in the Indo-Pacific. In addition, the United States and India will be working together like never before to confront the threat of radical Islamic terrorism, a threat all over the world actually. Today I'm pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters and one of the very evil people of the world and having to do with the horrific 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack to face justice in India. So he's going to be going back to India to face justice. As we deepen our defense partnership, we'll also strengthen our economic ties and bring greater fairness and reciprocity to our trading relationship.

( 21:37 ) As a signal of good faith, Prime Minister Modi recently announced the reductions to India's unfair, very strong tariffs that limit US access into the Indian market very strongly and really it's a big problem, I must say. India imposes a 30% to 40% to 60% and even 70% tariff on so many of the goods, and in some cases far more than that. And as an example, a 70% tariff on US cars going into India, which makes it pretty much impossible to sell those cars. Today, the US trade deficit with India is almost $100 billion dollars and Prime Minister Modi and I have agreed that we'll begin negotiations to address the long-running disparities that should have been taken care of over the last four years but they didn't do that in the US-India trading relationship with the goal of a signing an agreement and really we want a certain level playing field, which we really think we're entitled to and he does also in fairness.

( 22:47 ) We're going to work on that very hard and we can make up the difference very easily with the deficit, with the sale of oil and gas, LNG, of which we have more than anybody in the world. The Prime Minister and I also reached an important agreement on energy that will restore the United States as a leading supplier of oil and gas to India. We'll be hopefully their number one supplier. In the groundbreaking development for US nuclear industry, India is also reforming its laws to welcome US nuclear technology, which is at the highest level into the Indian market. This will bring safe, clean, and affordable electricity to millions of Indians and tens of billions of dollars to the US civilian nuclear industry in India. And under the framework we are announcing today, the United States and India are also joining forces to ensure that artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies are developed by the two of the most advanced nations intellectually and otherwise technologically anywhere in the world.

( 23:54 ) There's nobody very much closer. We have an incredible relationship there and this is where it seems to be heading. And artificial intelligence, a very complex subject, but it seems to be where people want to be and they want to go and we're leading right now by a lot, but other people will try to catch us. I don't know if they're going to be able to. We're going to make it available. We're going to make tremendous amounts of electricity available. We're going to let the people that are buying the electricity make their own electric plants, electric generation plants, and we've never done this in our country, but we're going to get it done very quickly. Lee Zeldin and his group are going to get the approvals in very rapid form and we're calling it a national emergency, and that's exactly what it is. So we're going to remain at the top of the AI or artificial intelligence, I think for a long time to come. And we're going to be working very closely with India and other countries on that, but right now we're a leader by quite a bit.

( 24:58 ) Finally, we agreed to work together to help build one of the greatest trade routes in all of history. It will run from India to Israel to Italy and onward to the United States, connecting our partners by ports, railways, and undersea cables. Many, many undersea cables. It's a big development. It's a lot of money going to be spent and we've already spent some, but we're going to be spending a lot more for them to stay advanced and stay the leader. I'm pleased to report that with today's announcements, the friendship between the United States and India is the strongest I believe it's ever been. I think our relationship is the best it's ever been between two leaders of the two countries and it's an honor to say that. I'd like to now invite the Prime Minister to say a few words and then we'll take some questions and we appreciate you all being here. Thank you very much.

Prime Minister Modi ( 25:51 ):

Your Excellency [foreign language 00:26:03].

Interpreter ( 26:03 ):

Your Excellency, President Trump, delegates of both countries, friends from the media, Namaskar, I would like to first of all express my heartfelt gratitude to my dear friend, President Trump, for the grand welcome and hospitality accorded to me. President Trump's leadership has been instrumental in nurturing India-U.S and making them vibrant. I could feel today the same enthusiasm, the same energy, the same commitment that we had worked with during our first term.

( 27:12 ) Our discussions today highlighted pride in our accomplishments during his first term, the deep mutual trust that we share, and the resolve to attain new goals. We all believe that the partnership and cooperation between India and the US can shape a better word. Friends, the people of America are aware of President Trump's motto, Make America Great Again or MAGA, the people of America. The people of India too are focusing on both heritage and development as they move forward at a fast pace with a firm resolve and ensure a developed India by 24/7. If I were to say this, borrowing an expression from America, our vision for a developed India is to make India great again or MIGA.

( 28:42 ) When America and India work together, that is when MAGA, when it's MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes MEGA, a MEGA partnership for prosperity. And it's this MEGA spirit that gives new scale and scope to our objectives. Friends, today we have also set ourselves the target of more than doubling our bilateral trade to attain $500 billion by 2030. Our teams will work on concluding very soon a mutually beneficial trade agreement. In order to ensure India's energy security, we will focus on trade in oil and gas. Investment in energy infrastructure will also increase in the area of nuclear energy. We also discussed increasing cooperation on small modular reactors. Friends, America plays an important role in India's defense preparedness. As strategic and trusted partners, we are moving forward actively towards joint development, joint production, and transfer of technology. In the times to come as well, new technologies and equipment will enhance our capacities.

( 31:02 ) We have decided to launch the autonomous systems industry alliance. A defense cooperation framework for the next decade will be prepared. Interoperability, logistics, repair, and maintenance will also be its key components. When the 21st century is a technology-driven century, close cooperation in the area of technology, which we are countries that believe in democratic values can give new direction, strength, and opportunities to the entire humanity. India and the US

Interpreter ( 32:00 ):

… will jointly work in areas of artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum, biotechnology, and several other technologies. Today, we also agreed on TRUST, which stands for Transforming Relationships Utilizing Strategic Technology. Under this, our focus will be on establishing strong supply chains for critical minerals, advanced materials, and pharmaceuticals. We have also decided to launch a recovery and processing initiative for strategic minerals like lithium and rare earths. We have had close cooperation with the US in the area of space. The NISAR satellite, developed with mutual cooperation between Israel and NASA, will soon be flying into space on an Indian launch vehicle.

( 33:21 ) Friends, partnership between India and the US strengthens democracy, and strengthens democratic values and systems. We will work together to enhance peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. The Quad will play a special role in this. During the Quad summit, scheduled to be held in India this year, we will expand cooperation in new areas with our partner countries. Under the IMEEC and I2U2, we will work together for the development of economic corridors, and in the area of connectivity. India and US will stand strongly together in the fight against terrorism. We agree that in order to eliminate cross-border terrorism, we need concrete actions, and I'm very grateful to President Trump that in 2008, somebody who carried out genocide in India, that criminal is now going to be handed over to India, and I'm grateful to President Trump for this, and appropriate action will be taken in the courts in India.

( 34:59 ) Friends, the Indian community living in the US is an important link in our relations. In order to further deepen our people-to-people ties, India will soon open new consulates in Los Angeles and Boston. These will be new consulates. We have invited some American educational institutes to open their offshore campuses in India.

( 35:35 ) President Trump, I am grateful to you for your friendship and strong commitment towards India. The people of India still fondly remember your visit in 2020, and hope that President Trump will come and visit them again. On behalf of 1.4 billion Indians, I invite you to visit India. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Donald Trump ( 36:28 ):

Thank you very much. Great job. Okay, thank you very much. That was excellent. We'll do a few questions, please.

Journalists ( 36:36 ):

Mr. President?

( 36:36 ) Mr. President?

Donald Trump ( 36:36 ):

Please, go ahead. Please, go ahead. Yeah. Yeah, blue shirt.

Lalit Jha ( 36:43 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. People in India will naturally welcome your decision to extradite Tahawwur Rana to India back home. In that context, I'd like to ask you a question about in the last few years, we have seen several groups in the US been raising anti-India voice, calling about separation… Terrorism activities in India. Do you think that should continue here in the US as well?

Donald Trump ( 37:03 ):

You're going to have to go louder.

Lalit Jha ( 37:03 ):

Mr. President, people in India will be welcoming your decision to extradite Tahawwur Rana to India-

Donald Trump ( 37:10 ):

Yeah, I can't understand a word he's saying. It's the accent, it's a little bit tough for me.

Lalit Jha ( 37:10 ):

Can I try?

Donald Trump ( 37:19 ):

How about you? Please. Go ahead, back there.

Speaker 6 ( 37:20 ):

Mr. President, thank you. First, I want to ask-

Speaker 8 ( 37:20 ):

Thank you very much.

Speaker 6 ( 37:26 ):

… the prime minister a question. You and the president, you both spoke about combating ISIS. You both sounded very excited about this, excited about this partnership upcoming. And I was curious, how much more confident are you with President Trump leading this country that there will be peace through strength and you will have a successful partnership with United States, versus with Biden's incompetence and weakness over the last four years?

Donald Trump ( 38:03 ):

That's your question, but I'll answer it. I agree with you. Yeah, gross incompetence. We're going to have a fantastic relationship. And it has been like the whole world's been set back over the last four years by the weakness of the United States, the weak leadership of the United States. But I think we've taken care of it in just three weeks. It seems to me that even some of the media that we wouldn't prefer has been writing that this is a much different country right now, that the world has a light over it. Not only our country, but the whole world. The Prime Minister told me that before, too. Even over India, the world has a light. They need the United States to be strong and powerful, but good. And I think that's happened, and I think it's happened in a very short period of time. But I will tell you, we're going to have a fantastic relationship, and it will make both countries much stronger.

Journalists ( 38:54 ):

Mr. President?

( 38:54 ) Mr. President, [inaudible 00:38:55].

( 38:54 ) Mr. President, I have a question about-

( 38:54 ) [inaudible 00:38:58].

Donald Trump ( 38:54 ):

Yes, go ahead, please.

Geeta Mohan ( 39:06 ):

Okay, Geeta Mohan from India Today, sir. I'll just take my colleague Lalit Jha's question forward because you couldn't understand-

Donald Trump ( 39:11 ):

Okay. Fine.

Geeta Mohan ( 39:13 ):

The question is about the fact that you've decided to extradite Tahawwur Rana. Thank you so much. India has been waiting to have him back in India to bring him to justice. But there are many other elements in the United States of America, particularly Khalistani separatists who've been working against Indian interests. How's the United States of America going to cooperate on that front with India? There have been allegations that have been levied against Indian agencies by the Biden administration. Are you going to re-look that with Tulsi Gabbard as DNI now?

Donald Trump ( 39:50 ):

Well, I don't think India had a very good relationship with the Biden administration. Biden, they wouldn't sell them oil and gas, which is rather hard to believe, because it's a good thing to do. And a lot of things happened that weren't very appropriate, I thought, between India and the administration, the Biden administration. But as you said, we're giving a very violent man, it seems to me, and I don't know that he's been convicted yet or will be, but let's assume he is a pretty violent person, we're giving him back to India immediately. And there are more to follow, because we have quite a few requests. So, we work with India on crime, and we want to make it good for India, and it's very important. So, that kind of a relationship is very important to us. Okay?

Journalists ( 40:35 ):

Mr. President?

( 40:35 ) Mr. President?

( 40:35 ) [inaudible 00:40:37].

Donald Trump ( 40:35 ):

Go ahead, please.

Speaker 7 ( 40:35 ):

Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 40:35 ):

Go ahead.

Speaker 7 ( 40:44 ):

Thank you. President, you've repeatedly called India a big abuser of trade, and said it is really difficult to do business in India because of tariffs. You announced reciprocal tariffs today. I am hoping you can speak about what kind of reciprocal tariffs India can expect. Are you willing to make any concessions, and how can India head off these tariffs? I also have one for the Prime Minister.

Donald Trump ( 41:08 ):

Sure. Well, India has been, to us, just about the highest tariffed nation anywhere in the world. They've been very strong on tariffs, and I don't blame them, necessarily, but it's a different way of doing business. It's very hard to sell into India because they have trade barriers, very strong tariffs.

( 41:27 ) We are, right now, a reciprocal nation. We are going to, if it's India or if it's somebody else with low tariffs, we're going to have the same. We're going to have whatever India charges, we're charging them; whatever another country charges, we're charging them. So, it's called reciprocal, which I think is a very fair way. We didn't have that. I was going to do that in my other term, and we had the greatest economy ever in the world. There's never been an economy like we had.

( 41:54 ) And then we got hit with COVID, we had a focus on that. And I wasn't really in the mood to be putting it on Italy and Spain and France and India, frankly, and a lot of other countries, because the world was very troubled until we got rid of that nightmare. But we had the strongest economy anywhere in the world during that fairly long period of time during my first term, as you know, and that we didn't do the tariffs, and we would've done the reciprocal tariffs. But we decided, and I decided, I think, on a human basis, on a humane basis, not to do them because of the fact that there was such suffering all over the world. The last thing we needed to talk about is trade problems.

( 42:35 ) But now we do. We see a tremendous future for our country, but we felt that now it's finally time, after 45 or 50 years of abuse, that we will do… And this isn't India, this is among a lot of nations. The European Union is very difficult for us, very, very difficult. They tax our companies at levels that nobody's ever seen before. They take advantage of a lot of things, so we're not happy about that. China, of course, is terrible, and we've never taken in 10 cents until I was president. We've taken in hundreds of billions of dollars from China since I've been president, in the first term and now, and we have to do that just as a mechanism of fairness, and that's what I've done.

( 43:19 ) And so we are being reciprocal with India. Whatever India charges, we charge them. So frankly, it no longer matters to us that much what they charge, because whatever they charge… I had discussions with India in the first term about the fact that their tariffs were very high and I was unable to get a concession. So, we're just going to do it the easy way. We're just going to say, "Whatever you charge, we charge." And I think that's fair for the people of the United States, and I think it's actually fair for India. Okay?

Journalists ( 43:49 ):

[inaudible 00:43:49].

Donald Trump ( 43:49 ):

Go ahead, please. Ask to the Prime Minister, please.

Yoshita Singh ( 44:01 ):

A question for the Prime Minister, please.

Donald Trump ( 44:01 ):

Ask to the Prime Minister, please.

Yoshita Singh ( 44:02 ):

Yes, sorry. Yoshita Singh with Press Trust of India. Thank you, Mr. President. Prime Minister, the US is giving a lot of push to curb illegal immigration, and India has been cooperating on this issue. How does India see this issue in the larger context? Thank you.

Interpreter ( 44:19 ):

This is a question that is about India only, but even globally, you can talk about this issue. And we are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally, they have absolutely no right to be in that country. And as far as India and the US is concerned, we have always been of the same opinion, and that is that any verified Indian who is in the US illegally, we are fully prepared to take them back to India.

( 45:16 ) However, it doesn't stop there. These are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and big promises. A lot of them are brought in without them knowing about why they're going to a country. And, in fact, they are connected with a human trafficking system. And we have to make sure that we fight against this system. As far as the US and India is concerned, I think what we should do is make efforts to make sure that we uproot these from within the system, so that we can reduce or remove human trafficking. And basically the young, vulnerable, poor people of India are fooled into coming over as illegal immigrants, and our bigger fight actually is against this ecosystem or this system that encourages such gangs to thrive. And I can tell you that-

Journalists ( 46:21 ):

[inaudible 00:46:22].

( 46:21 ) Mr. President? Mr. President?

Interpreter ( 46:21 ):

… India will completely support.

Donald Trump ( 46:21 ):

Yes.

Speaker 5 ( 46:33 ):

Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. A question for Prime Minister Modi first, if I may. I wanted to ask you, did you discuss any possible business deals with Elon Musk during your meetings today, Mr. Prime Minister? And Mr. President, I wanted to ask you: today, you spoke about hoping to have three-way talks with President Xi and President Putin. What would you say to European leaders and other allies who may be concerned that you're apparently more keen to speak to America's adversaries than to its allies? Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 47:01 ):

Maybe I'll just go first on this one. We had some talks, and we told the European Union, we told the NATO people, largely, they overlap, "You have to pay more money, because it's unfair what we're doing. We're doing a tremendous amount more." We're probably $200 billion more going into Ukraine, using for Ukraine to fight. And Europe has not really carried its weight, in terms of the money. It's not equitable. And we want to see a counterbalance. We want to have them put up more money. They have to do that.

( 47:43 ) At the same time, we had a very good conversation with President Putin the other day, yesterday, and we also had a very good conversation, I did both, in both cases, with President Zelenskyy. And I think we're going to be able to do something, I think we're going to be able to make a deal. And I hope so, because

Donald Trump ( 48:00 ):

… because it's a horrible war. It's a very terrible, bloody war with a million and a half soldiers, at least, already dead on the battlefield, lying all over the fields like, nobody has ever seen anything like it, certainly since the Second World War.

( 48:14 ) So, I think we're going to be able to do something. We're working with President Zelenskyy and with President Putin, and my impression is that they … I know that President Zelenskyy wants to make a deal, and I also feel that, I know that President Putin wants to make a deal. I wanted to know that before I began any detailed discussions.

( 48:33 ) But the meeting and the conversation, also, the meeting with Steve Witkoff in Moscow was a very successful one, and my phone call with him was a very successful one.

( 48:45 ) Please.

Narendra Modi ( 48:45 ):

[foreign language 00:48:49]

Interpreter ( 48:51 ):

You asked a question regarding Elon Musk. I have known him for a very long time. I was not even prime minister at the time when I first met him; I was chief minister. And today he came to meet me along with all his family, with his children. And so, we had a nice discussion.

( 49:11 ) As far as the EVs are concerned, the word EV has a copyright. And that is one person who has a copyright for the word EV, and that is Trump.

Donald Trump ( 49:39 ):

Thank you. That was very nice.

( 49:39 ) Go ahead, please.

Speaker 6 ( 49:39 ):

Thank you, Mr. President. Can I ask whether you discussed at all today the case of Gautam Adani, who's one of the wealthiest men in Asia and perceived as an ally of Prime Minister Modi?

( 49:49 ) Prime Minister Modi, have you asked the president to take action on that case? Thank you.

Interpreter ( 50:00 ):

Firstly, India is a democratic country, and our culture and our thought philosophy is Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which basically means that the entire world is a family. Every Indian is my own family member. And when it comes to such personal matters, leaders of two countries will not get together on that topic and discuss anything on an individual matter.

Donald Trump ( 50:35 ):

Go ahead. Please. Yeah. Please.

Speaker 9 ( 50:36 ):

Which one?

Donald Trump ( 50:36 ):

Sir, go ahead, please.

Speaker 9 ( 50:37 ):

Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I have a question for you as well.

( 50:41 ) But, Mr. President, you have suggested, with regards to the Russia-Ukraine war, you've suggested several things that Ukraine should give up: the idea of NATO membership, territory that was seized back in 2014 by Russia. What should Russia give up?

Donald Trump ( 50:57 ):

Russia has gotten themselves into something that I think they wish they didn't. If I were president, it would not have happened, absolutely would not have happened, and it didn't happen for four years.

( 51:09 ) If you look at what has taken place, under President Bush, they lost a lot. Under President Obama, they lost Crimea. Under Biden, it looks like they could lose the whole thing. Under Trump, they lost nothing, Ukraine lost nothing. They didn't give up anything. And you take a look at the other three presidents surrounding me, they gave up a lot.

( 51:35 ) I think that when you look at Ukraine and when you look at the mess that they're in, it's got to be ended, and it's got to be stopped.

( 51:43 ) Now, Russia has taken over a pretty big chunk of territory, and they also have said from day one, long before President Putin, they've said they cannot have Ukraine be in NATO. They said that very strongly.

( 51:59 ) I actually think that that was the thing that caused the start of the war. And Biden said it, and Zelenskyy said it, and I think that was one of the reasons, one of the starts of the war.

( 52:10 ) But from long before Putin, they said you cannot have Ukraine going in, in any way, into NATO. And I start from that standpoint. I think everybody knew that.

( 52:24 ) Now, if a better deal can be negotiated, if they were able to make a deal where they can do that, that's fine with me. I really don't care. I want that bloodshed to stop. I don't want to see … We have an ocean between us and the site we're talking about, the site of death. We're calling it the fields of death. We have a big ocean in between us. This is more important for Europe. We shouldn't be in. They have to equalize, and they're going to have to do it fast, but they have to equalize.

( 52:54 ) But as far as the negotiation, it's too early to say what's going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won't, and it's all dependent on what is going to happen. The negotiation really hasn't started.

( 53:07 ) But I will say, as far as NATO is concerned, from many years before President Putin, I will tell you that I've heard that Russia would never accept that, and I think Ukraine knew that, because Ukraine wasn't in and never requested to be in until more recently. So, that's the way it is, and I think that's the way it's going to have to be.

Speaker 9 ( 53:25 ):

But, Mr. President … Mr. President, I-

Donald Trump ( 53:25 ):

Go ahead, please.

( 53:25 ) All right. Go ahead, please, with the tie. With the tie, yeah.

Saurabh Shukla ( 53:33 ):

Mr. President.

Donald Trump ( 53:34 ):

Yes, go ahead, please.

Saurabh Shukla ( 53:37 ):

This is Saurabh Shukla from NewsMobile. Mr. President, you spoke about Prime Minister Modi as a tough negotiator. Who was a tougher negotiator today, and who has a better negotiating tactic when it comes to tariffs with-

Donald Trump ( 53:48 ):

Oh, he's a much tougher negotiator than me, and he's a much better negotiator than me. There's not even a contest. Okay?

( 53:51 ) Yeah, go ahead. Please. Go ahead. Go ahead.

Reena Bhardwaj ( 54:02 ):

Reena Bhardwaj from ANI. How do you see this relationship between the India and the United States to counter China? And what is your vision when it comes to India brokering peace in the Ukraine and Russia conflict?

Donald Trump ( 54:19 ):

Well, I think we are going to have a very good relationship with China. I got along with President Xi very well until COVID. That was a bridge too far. But until then, I got along with President Xi very, very well. We were very close, as leaders go. I don't want to be naive, but as leaders go, I think we were very close.

( 54:38 ) And I think that China is a very important player in the world. I think they can help us get this war over with Ukraine and Russia.

( 54:46 ) And I look at India, I do see the skirmishes on the border, which are quite vicious, and I guess they continue to go on. If I could be of help, I'd love to help, because that should be stopped. That's been going on for a long time, and it's quite violent. It's quite violent.

( 55:03 ) But I would hope that China and India and Russia and U.S. and all of us can get along. It's very important.

( 55:12 ) You know, the power of weaponry today is, and not only nuclear, but nuclear in particular, the power of weaponry is very important. I said before that I had very constructive talks in my first term with President Putin about the denuclearization of the two countries. And then we were going to go to China after we worked some kind of a deal, and we had the confines of a deal. We were, I thought we … He really wanted to do it and so did I, denuclearize. And it's such a beautiful term, when you think about it. In other words, to bring it down, because the power of those weapons is too great.

( 55:51 ) And I did speak to President Xi about that, and I was getting also a very good response. He's building a very strong nuclear power. He's not very close to Russia or the United States right now, but he will be soon. I mean, he'll catch up over the period of four or five years, they say.

( 56:09 ) But it would be a great thing if we could, on a military basis, we're going to spend this year 900, let's say $915 billion on military. Russia, without the war, was spending close to a hundred, but with the war, I can't tell you what they're spending, but they're spending a lot. And China is spending $400 and $450 billion. We're over $900 billion. And I said, "You know, it doesn't really make sense." I said, "We're spending the money against each other, and we could spend that money for better purpose if we got along." And I'll tell you, I think that something like that will happen.

( 56:45 ) First, when I left, as you know, four years ago, we didn't have Israel and the Middle East. We didn't have October 7th, what a disaster, the disaster. Nothing was happening. Iran was not going to do anything, because Iran did not have much money at that point. They were broke. They were totally broke. They didn't have money for Hamas or for Hezbollah. And you didn't have Russia with Ukraine, and that would never have happened.

( 57:12 ) But now I come back, and the whole world is on fire, so I have to put out the fires. But after I put out the fires, I'm going to meet with China, and I'm going to meet with Russia, and we're going to see if we can de-escalate, if we can bring it down, military, especially as it pertains to nuclear.

( 57:27 ) Please.

Speaker 10 ( 57:27 ):

Mr. President, you mentioned about American Islamic terrorism-

Speaker 11 ( 57:45 ):

Prime Minister, how do you see India play a role in de-escalating the Ukraine-Russia-

Speaker 12 ( 57:52 ):

[foreign language 00:57:52]

Interpreter ( 57:53 ):

Prime Minister, how do you see India's role? You have had discussions with President Trump about de-escalating the conflict in Russia and Ukraine.

( 57:58 ) As you know, I have been in constant contact with both Russia and Ukraine. I have also visited both countries. And many peoples are mistaken and they feel that India is neutral. I would like to clarify: India is not neutral. We have taken a side, and we have taken the side of peace.

( 58:28 ) And it is based on this principle of ours that, in the presence of President Putin, I clearly said in front of the media that this is not the era of war. And even today, it is my conviction that solutions cannot be found on the battlefield. Ultimately, you have to come to the negotiating table, and India has constantly made efforts that there are talks that take place where both parties are present. It is only then that we will find a solution.

( 59:11 ) The efforts being made by President Trump, I support them, I welcome them, and I would like that President Trump is successful as soon as possible so that the world is on the path to peace once again.

Donald Trump ( 59:25 ):

Everybody, thank you very much. Thank you very much.

( 59:33 ) And I very much appreciate the prime minister visiting our great country, and I do really appreciate it. We have so much in common, and all we want to do is have peace, and we want to have strength, and we want to have lots of different things together, but the relationship with India and with the prime minister has never been better.

( 59:50 ) Thank you very much.

Speaker 13 ( 59:51 ):

Mr. President-

Press ( 59:55 ):

Keep your seats. Keep your seats.

Speaker 14 ( 01:00:14 ):

Keep your seats.

Press ( 01:00:37 ):

Keep your seat.

Donald Trump ( 01:00:37 ):

Thank you.

Speaker 15 ( 01:00:37 ):

Thank you so much for that.
