President Donald Trump ( 00:00 ):

Hello everybody. Any questions?

Speaker 3 ( 00:04 ):

How was the golf tournament?

President Donald Trump ( 00:06 ):

Very good because I won. It's good to win. You heard I won.

Speaker 3 ( 00:11 ):

What was your score, sir?

President Donald Trump ( 00:11 ):

Did you hear I won? Just to pack it up there, I won.

Speaker 5 ( 00:18 ):

What's your handicap?

President Donald Trump ( 00:21 ):

Very low. I have a very low handicap. Okay, let's go.

Speaker 2 ( 00:23 ):

Sir, Chinese foreign ministry said that the market is spoken when asked about the tariffs, what do you make of that?

President Donald Trump ( 00:33 ):

The market is spoken when they look at the fact that we have a billion dollar trade deficit. When you look at the trade deficit that we have with certain countries, way over a million per country. But with China, it's a trillion dollars. And we have to solve our trade deficit with China. We have a trillion dollar trade deficit with China. Hundreds of billions of dollars a year we lose with China. And unless we solve that problem, I'm not going to make a deal. Now, I'm willing to deal with China, but they have to solve their surplus. We have a tremendous deficit problem with China.

( 01:10 ) They have a surplus of at least a trillion dollars a year. I think it's like a trillion one, and I want that solved. And no other president's taken it on. I had to take it on the last time, then we had a rigged election. No other president's taken it on. And so, China is… They say the market's smoking. The market… China is right now taking a big hit because everyone knows we're right. They have to pay tariffs because otherwise we have a surplus and they have a surplus with us. That is not sustainable.

Jennifer ( 01:46 ):

Mr. President.

President Donald Trump ( 01:47 ):

And we're talking about a trillion dollars, you know that right? We're not going to lose a trillion dollars for the privilege of buying pencils from China.

Jennifer ( 01:55 ):

On the idea of crashing the markets on purpose, there's been some speculation, partly because of the video that was posted on Truth Social, that there was some sort of deliberate effort on your part to have the market sell off. Can you talk about that, whether that's-

President Donald Trump ( 02:12 ):

That's not so, but I do want to solve the deficit problem that we have with China, with the European Union and other nations, and they're going to have to do that. And if they want to talk about that, I'm open to talking. But otherwise, why would I want to talk? And as you know, because of the tariffs, we have $7 trillion already committed to be invested in the United States, building auto plants, building chip companies, and all sorts of companies are coming into our country at levels that we've never seen before. Biden had nothing coming [inaudible 00:02:48] and this was a dead company. This was a dead country with Biden. He didn't know what he was doing. And that's now been proven at least.

Jennifer ( 02:56 ):

This weekend, you talked to a lot of leaders this weekend. Can you tell us, sir, were there any deals made?

President Donald Trump ( 03:01 ):

I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world, they're dying to make a deal. And I said, "We are not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that because to me, a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or we're at worst going to be breaking even." But China would be the worst in the group because the deficit is so big and it's not sustainable. And I was elected on this. This was one of the biggest reasons I got elected was exactly because of this. And we're going to put tariffs… We've already put them on. It's not a question if we will, we're going to put them on. And those tariffs next year will make us $1 trillion. In addition to the $1 trillion, thousands of companies are going to relocate back into the United States.

( 03:56 ) In North Carolina, already furniture people are starting to move back in. In Detroit and Michigan, which I won because of what I said what I'm telling you, car companies are starting to open up. In Indiana, a big one is under construction as an example, Honda. But they're moving in like nobody's ever seen this before. So it's unsustainable for us to allow China to have surpluses of a trillion dollars. We will be taking in over a trillion dollars over the next short period of time with the tariffs that I've already instituted. They're already in place. Now what's going to happen with the market? I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger and eventually, it'll be a country like no other. It'll be the most dominant country economically in the world.

Speaker 5 ( 04:51 ):

Mr. President-

President Donald Trump ( 04:52 ):

Which is what it should be.

Speaker 5 ( 04:52 ):

Is there a Trump put, though? Is there pain in the market at some point you're unwilling to tolerate this idea of a Trump put. Is there a threshold?

President Donald Trump ( 05:03 ):

I think your question is so stupid. I think it's… I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something. And we have such a horrible… We have been treated so badly by other countries because we had stupid leadership that allowed this to happen. They took our businesses, they took our money, they took our jobs, they moved it to Mexico, they moved it to Canada, they moved a lot of it to China, and it's not sustainable. We're not going to do it now. We have hundreds of billions of dollars that's pouring into our country on a monthly basis. It's pouring, it's already started because they put tariffs on, and eventually it's going to straighten out and our country will be solid and strong again.

Speaker 6 ( 05:49 ):

Elon Musk has said he hopes for zero tariffs between the US and Europe. Is that a place you'd like to also get to?

President Donald Trump ( 05:54 ):

Well, the problem is that Europe has made a fortune with us. Europe also has had a tremendous surplus with the United States. Europe has treated us, it's a little smaller, but they've treated us very, very badly. China has, but Europe has also. Europe has been very, very bad to us. Europe has taken our leaders for a ride. They don't take our cars, they don't take our food products, they don't take anything. And we take their cars, Mercedes, Volkswagen, BMW, we take their millions of cars, they take no cars. They don't take our farm product, they don't take anything. Europe's treated us very badly. We put a big tariff on Europe. They are coming to the table, they want to talk, but there's no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis, number one, for present, but also for past because they've taken a lot of our wealth away and we're not going to allow it to happen.

Speaker 7 ( 06:52 ):

Sir, have you talked to any tech leaders over the weekend about the tariffs?

President Donald Trump ( 06:56 ):

Yeah, I talked to the biggest in the world. I talked to the biggest of them all. Many of them. But I've talked to, I would say four or five that are considered the biggest. You know what they said? We don't blame you.

Speaker 7 ( 07:12 ):

Who did you talk to?

President Donald Trump ( 07:15 ):

I don't want to say, I'll put it out. I may give it to you.

Speaker 7 ( 07:18 ):

Nvidia [inaudible 00:07:18]?

President Donald Trump ( 07:19 ):

I have to find out if they mind. I don't know if that was a confidential call or not, but we had five or six. I've spoken in many countries. They all want to do… Just so you understand the power of what I'm doing. Every country is calling and being very solicitous of us. Very, very nice, and being very nice. And we have to be able to justify. This is not sustainable. The United States can't lose $1.9 trillion for trade. We can't do that, and also spend a lot of money on NATO in order to protect European nations. We cover them with military, then we lose money on trade, and the whole thing is crazy. And I got elected on that basis. We explained it. The American people understand it a lot better than the media, but the media understands it. And much of the media writes correctly about it, I must say.

Speaker 8 ( 08:14 ):

Sir?

President Donald Trump ( 08:15 ):

Okay.

Speaker 8 ( 08:15 ):

Sir, when are the next set of talks with Russia and who will participate and where are we in terms of making progress in terms of peace?

President Donald Trump ( 08:22 ):

We're talking to Russia. We'd like it to stop. I don't like the bombing. The bombing goes on and on and every week people, and thousands of young people are being killed. And it's a horrible thing that should have never started, would've never started if I were president, 100%.

Speaker 5 ( 08:40 ):

On the tariffs, is it a negotiation now? Bloomberg, sir, is it a negotiation or rules of the road?

President Donald Trump ( 08:47 ):

Go ahead. Another question, please.

Speaker 8 ( 08:49 ):

Sir. About-

President Donald Trump ( 08:50 ):

She asks too many questions.

Speaker 9 ( 08:56 ):

Sir, about TikTok, there was the report there was about to be a deal, but China changed its mind because of the tariffs.

President Donald Trump ( 08:58 ):

I'd say it was largely true. The report is that we had a deal pretty much for TikTok, not a deal, but pretty close. And then, China changed the deal because of tariffs. If I gave a little cut in tariffs, they'd approved that deal in 15 minutes, which shows you the power of tariffs.

Speaker 10 ( 09:13 ):

President, former New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu is saying that he'll win the open Senate seat in New Hampshire and that he has no doubt you'll support him if he runs. Is that true?

President Donald Trump ( 09:23 ):

True. I told him. He came to my office, came to the Oval Office and met with Chris Sununu, and I support him fully. I hope he runs. He's been very nice to me over the last year or so. But no, I hope he runs. I think he'll win that seat.

Speaker 2 ( 09:40 ):

Sir, when we get into late summer, early fall and people are doing their back to school shopping, do you think they'll have inflation to worry about at that point?

President Donald Trump ( 09:49 ):

I think there's not going to be, I don't think inflation's going to be a big deal because if you look at me, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars. This is not new to me. I took in during my four years, hundreds of billions of dollars from China and we also took in a lot of money from other countries, but in particular China, because it was just getting started. And we had no inflation. Who had inflation was Biden. Biden had the worst inflation in the history of our country. I had no inflation. We had a perfect country, we had no wars. I ended them all. I defeated ISIS, everything was good. And then when this numbskull got in, they really call themselves now numbskulls. But when he got in, bad things happened to our country, including our open border. And now we're doing very well with… We have the best numbers on the border that we've ever had.

Speaker 7 ( 10:44 ):

Speaking of the border, have you talked to Attorney General Pam Bondi recently about the cases going on with the deportations?

President Donald Trump ( 10:49 ):

Yeah, sure. It's really sad when you think that Biden allowed millions of people to come in and if they find one… Now, I will tell you, the one, somebody said he's a member of MS 13, not Tren de Aragua. He's a member of MS 13 and therefore, he should immediately be brought back. Well, MS 13 is just as bad as Tren de Aragua. So they say, "Oh, we made a mistake because he's not with them. He's with MS 13. Bring him back, bring him back." MS 13 is a very bad group.

Speaker 8 ( 11:22 ):

Sir, how concerned-

President Donald Trump ( 11:23 ):

Maybe as bad, actually.

Speaker 8 ( 11:25 ):

How concerned are you about the measles outbreak? There was another fatality today. And what else would you like to see in terms of the response?

President Donald Trump ( 11:31 ):

Well, I think they're doing reports on it. It's so far a fairly small number of people relative to what we're talking about. Something that people have known about for many, many years. I mean, measles has been… You know, this is not something new and we'll see what happens. But certainly, if something… If it progresses, we'll have to take action very strongly.

Speaker 10 ( 11:55 ):

El Salvador's president said on X that he'd been invited to the White House on April 14 for a working visit to discuss Tren de Aragua, MS 13, and other ways we can support each other in the US and El Salvador. I was curious if you could expand more on what some of these other ideas you have for El Salvador.

President Donald Trump ( 12:11 ):

Well, I think… Yeah, I think… You're in the way of that camera by the way. You should at least say that, the camera operator should probably say that she's shooting the back of your head. I don't know why she doesn't say it. I have to say it and say it. I have great respect for him. I know him. I've known him for a long time. He's a young leader and he's very tough on crime. Very, very tough on crime. And in their system, their prison system, they spend a tiny fraction of the money that this country spends. But he is coming in. I don't know when, but he is coming in probably sometime over the next couple of weeks.

Speaker 9 ( 12:51 ):

What are you and Prime Minister Netanyahu going to speak about tomorrow?

President Donald Trump ( 12:54 ):

We're going to talk about trade and we're going to talk about the obvious subject. You know what the obvious subject is.

Speaker 9 ( 12:58 ):

Do you have any news for us on the obvious subject?

President Donald Trump ( 13:02 ):

I'm trying to do trade just to keep it down. Well, there's a lot of things going on with the Middle East right now that have to be silenced. We had no problem with the Middle East. Everything was done. We had no problem with Iran. We had no problem with anybody. And then you had October 7th and that was all because Iran, as you know, was not giving money to anybody because they had no money. Now they have a lot of money. So we'll see what happens.

Speaker 10 ( 13:30 ):

Back to El Salvador, the president there said he would be willing to take American citizens in the federal prison population. Is that one of the ideas you're going to be discussing?

President Donald Trump ( 13:37 ):

Well, I love that. If we could take some of our 20 time wise guys that push people into subways and that hit people over the back of the head and that purposely run people over in cars, if he would take them, I'd be honored to give them. I don't know what the law says on that, but I can't imagine the law would say anything different. If they can house these horrible criminals for a lot less money than it costs us, I'm all for it, but I'd only do according to the law. But I have suggested that why should it stop just at people that cross the border illegally? We have some horrible criminals, American-grown and born, and if we have somebody that bops an old woman over the head and we have somebody that is in jail 20 times and goes back and shoots people all over the place and then has a bad judge or a bad prosecutor that do nothing about them, all they worry about is politics, they don't worry about that.

( 14:33 ) I think if we could get El Salvador or somebody to take them, I'd be very happy with it. But I have to see what the law says. Okay, what else?

Jennifer ( 14:42 ):

Mr. President, can you say, did you agree to lowering tariffs for any of the countries that you spoke to today? So-

President Donald Trump ( 14:48 ):

What you understand, Jennifer, you have to understand this. We have massive surplus countries that we're dealing with. We have massive deficits. We've got to straighten that out because you can't continue to be that way. It's been that way for years now and it can't go on any longer. And we're the piggy bank. We have all the advantages. Forget markets for a second. We have all the advantages. We're going to get it straightened out. We're going to become a wealthy nation again, wealthy like never before. And we're not going to let other nations that have been ripping us off, whether it's China or the European Union, with all of the European nations that have just made… It's been like a feast. Look, the European Union was formed for one reason. You know what that was? To rip off the United States. So put that in your bonnet. I hope you had a good flight. Have a good time.

Speaker 10 ( 15:40 ):

Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

Jennifer ( 15:42 ):

See you tomorrow.
