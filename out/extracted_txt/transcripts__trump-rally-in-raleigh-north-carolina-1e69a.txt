( 05:03 ) Till she kissed me and said.

( 05:03 ) Baby, please, go all the way.

( 05:03 ) It feels so right.

( 05:03 ) Being with you here tonight.

( 05:03 ) Please, go all the way.

( 05:03 ) Just hold me close.

( 05:03 ) Don't ever let me go.

( 05:03 ) Had a hole in the place where my heart should have been.

( 05:03 ) But now I'm changed and I feel so strange.

( 05:03 ) I come alive when she does all those things to me.

( 05:03 ) And she says.

( 05:03 ) Come on.

( 05:03 ) Come on.

( 13:10 ) Young man, I was once in your shoes.

( 13:10 ) I said, I was down and out with the blues.

( 13:10 ) I felt no man cared if I were alive.

( 13:18 ) I felt the whole world was so jive.

( 13:18 ) That's when someone came up to me and said.

( 18:51 ) 'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess.

( 18:51 ) This is a man's world, this is a man's world.

( 18:51 ) But it would be nothing, nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.

( 18:51 ) You see, man made the car to take us over the road.

( 20:36 ) Man made the train to carry the heavy load.

( 20:36 ) Man made electric light to take us out of the dark.

( 20:36 ) And man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark.

( 20:36 ) This is a man's world.

( 20:36 ) But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.

( 20:36 ) [foreign language 00:21:28]

( 20:36 ) Man thinks about a little bitty baby girl and a baby boy.

( 22:25 ) Man made them happy, because man made them toys.

( 22:25 ) And after man make everything he can.

( 22:25 ) Man makes lira, pesos, dollars, rubles to buy from other man.

( 22:25 ) This is a man's world.

( 22:25 ) [foreign language 00:23:00]

( 24:13 ) It's a damn shame what the world's gotten to.

( 24:17 ) For people like me and people like you.

( 24:20 ) Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.

( 24:24 ) But it is, oh it is.

( 24:28 ) Living in the new world.

( 24:30 ) With an old soul.

( 24:30 ) These rich men north of Richmond.

( 24:44 ) Want to know what you think, want to know what you do.

( 24:51 ) And they don't think you know, but I know that you do.

( 24:51 ) 'Cause your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end.

( 24:53 ) 'Cause of rich men north of Richmond.

( 24:54 ) I wish politicians would look out for miners.

( 25:11 ) And not just minors on an island somewhere.

( 25:14 ) Lord, we got folks in the street.

( 25:17 ) Ain't got nothing to eat.

( 25:19 ) And the obese milking welfare.

( 25:23 ) Well, God, if you're 5'3 and you're 300 pounds.

( 25:27 ) Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of Fudge Rounds.

( 25:31 ) Young men are putting themselves six feet in the ground.

( 25:35 ) 'Cause all this damn country does is keep on kicking them down.

( 25:40 ) Lord, it's a damn shame what the world's gotten to.

( 25:45 ) For people like me and people like you.

( 25:48 ) Wish I could just wake up and it not be true.

( 25:52 ) But it is, oh, it is.

( 25:53 ) Living in the new world. With an old soul.

( 26:00 ) These rich men north of Richmond.

( 26:00 ) Lord knows they all just want to have total control.

( 26:11 ) Want to know what your think.

( 26:12 ) Want to know what you do.

( 26:12 ) And they don't think you know, but I know that you do.

( 26:19 ) 'Cause your dollar ain't shit and it's taxed to no end.

( 26:22 ) 'Cause of rich men north of Richmond.

( 26:22 ) I've been selling my soul.

( 26:47 ) Working all day.

Speaker 1 ( 27:23 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome senior advisor to President Trump, Alina Habba.

Music ( 27:37 ):

All I do is win, win, win.

( 27:37 ) No matter what.

( 27:37 ) Got money on my mind.

( 27:37 ) I can never get enough.

( 27:37 ) And every time I step up in the building.

( 27:37 ) Everybody hands go up.

( 27:37 ) And they stay there.

( 27:37 ) And they say, yeah.

( 27:37 ) And they stay there.

( 27:37 ) Up, down, up, down, up, down.

( 27:37 ) 'Cause all I do is win, win.

Alina Habba ( 27:38 ):

We've got one more day to save this country. I just arrived with the greatest president this country has ever seen. He is back stage right now and he is ready to become the 47th president of the United States tomorrow. Raleigh, [inaudible 00:28:32], you're right. You're right. Listen, this has been quite a journey and today is my last rally with President Trump, so I'm a little sad. But I'm so happy to end it in North Carolina, I know North Carolina is going to make the difference. I can feel it. But we have to get every one of our friends, our mothers, our brothers, our cousins. Take your grandma, take her for a visit and take her to the polls. We have to vote.

( 29:11 ) You know, as I stand here, I realize it's been three and a half years since I started this with President Trump before that he even announced that he was going to run. And after experiencing the last three and a half years as a mom, as a woman, and as a business owner, I can tell you with certainty, we are not better off than we were when he left office. But I can also tell you something else, Kamala broke it, but Donald Trump will fix it.

Audience ( 29:46 ):

Vote, vote, vote.

Alina Habba ( 29:46 ):

Vote.

Audience ( 29:54 ):

Vote, vote, vote. Vote, vote, vote.

Alina Habba ( 30:01 ):

So I've done a few of these, and as my final speech, I just want to talk to you about the man that I do know, the man that's taken my children golfing, the man that is kind to every single person he meets. Thank you. And I can tell you that when I was tired in New York while they tried to stop us, he was never tired for one minute. He was never upset for one minute. And the only thing that gets him angry is when people mess with his country. President Trump has led the most amazing life. He has build skyscrapers. He has changed the skyline of New York. He built the Trump Organization. He saved this country in 2016. And after tomorrow, he will re-save and fix this country because there is nobody I know that loves America more than Donald Trump. That man has sacrificed everything and they have tried to take him down in every way possible through lawfare, through raids, through telling him his fans and his people and his American patriots are garbage. See, even my mic didn't like that. They've tried to say that he surrounds himself with stupid women who aren't strong. Nice try, Mark. But he has lifted me up, so today, I want to say thank you to all of you Americans, to everyone in North Carolina for rooting for us for the last three and a half years, for rooting for me, and for rooting for America, because tomorrow we will fix this country. We will elect Donald Trump as the 47th president of the United States. God bless you, North Carolina. God bless the United States and President Trump. Get out and vote. Thank you.

Music ( 32:30 ):

Blame it on the conure.

( 32:30 ) The hood call it Luda.

( 32:30 ) And I'm on this foolish track.

( 32:30 ) So I spit my foolish flow.

( 32:30 ) My hands go up and down.

( 32:31 ) Like strippers' booties go.

( 32:37 ) My verses still be serving tight.

( 32:37 ) Like a million virgins.

( 32:37 ) Last time on the Khaled remix.

( 32:37 ) Now I'm on the original version.

( 32:37 ) Can't never count me out.

( 32:37 ) Y'all better count me in.

( 32:37 ) Got twenty bank accounts.

( 32:37 ) Accountants count me in.

( 32:37 ) Make millions every year.

( 32:37 ) The south's champion.

( 32:37 ) 'Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I, all I do.

( 32:37 ) Is win, win, win.

Speaker 1 ( 32:52 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Donald Trump, Junior.

Donald Trump, Jr. ( 33:21 ):

Hello, North Carolina. How's it going? You guys ready to win and take our country back? Are you ready to stop the insanity, the Biden/Harris cost of living crisis that's crushing so many people? How about we stop the endless wars? How about that? Well, guys, we can do that, and we will do that, but we need each and every one of you to be a part of that. Early

Donald Trump, Jr. ( 34:00 ):

… early voting. I know a lot of people here have done it already in North Carolina, which means you now have… I'm seeing all the heads nod. It means you now have all day tomorrow to bring your friends to the polls. Do not take anything for granted, okay? Don't look at the polls, don't listen to the media. Don't fall for the PSYOPs. You see this stuff, right? Half this stuff is designed to demoralize you so you stay at home. The other stuff is designed to make you overconfident. So you stay at home. Get out and vote. Make your voices heard.

( 34:45 ) It's simple, guys. If you show up, if you bring your friends, we win. And more importantly, we can end it tomorrow. Because if we win decisively, if we win decisively, we stop them from playing the games where they drag it out for… Oh, yeah. You know what they're going to try to do. We've seen this playbook before, but this time we're prepared. So if we win decisively tomorrow, you don't give them a week to find that magical truck filled with ballots, right? No one knows where they came from, but… Take back your country, America. We went from a time of peace to a time of war in an instant. We went from a time of prosperity to a time of poverty faster than you could ever imagine. Kamala Harris is not going to change anything. We know that because she told us in her own words that she would not do anything differently. Four more years of Harris-Biden failure will get us to a point that we cannot recover. This is what they want. They want to be globalists. They want to replace Americans with the illegals who will be dependent on government and your taxpayer dollars. We know this because they're basically saying it at this point. They're not even pretending. They're saying all the quiet parts out loud, and so are the clowns that are representing them. So you guys, at this point, it is up to each and every one of you. So whatever you would do if you woke up on November 6th and Kamala Harris was President-elect, whatever you would do to stop that disaster for our country, for the world, and for Western civilization, whatever you would do, do it now. Do it till the polls close tomorrow night, and then start calling your friends on the West Coast to make sure they're doing it too.

( 37:04 ) Get in line. Bring your friends. Stay in line. If you see nonsense, video it. Show it to everyone. Do not let them play their games. And if we do that, guys, we will make America stronger than it's ever been because we've assembled a team like nothing before. It's not just my father against the swamp. You have JD Vance, you have RFK Jr. [inaudible 00:37:32] you have Tulsi Gabbard, and you have Elon Musk all ready to fight for you. So get out there. And with the same resolve that my father showed on July 13th when he took a bullet for America, you show that resolve, you show that level of fight, and you fight, fight, fight. Thank you, North Carolina. Get out there and do it. It's all on you.

Donald Trump ( 38:24 ):

What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? Look at the opportunities before us.

Speaker 2 ( 38:37 ):

This election really isn't about the left versus the right. It's about we, the people, choosing our government and the choice between freedom versus tyranny.

Speaker 3 ( 38:51 ):

Nobody has a chronic disease burden like we have. Why are we allowing this to happen to our children? Ultimately, the only thing that will save our country is if we choose to love our kids more than we hate each other.

Speaker 4 ( 39:08 ):

What is going on here is deeper than politics. It is deeply spiritual. We are being called to rise above the hatred and the fear and the evil.

Speaker 5 ( 39:22 ):

We need to remember, above and beyond, that we must love our neighbors, that we must treat other people as we hope to be treated.

Speaker 6 ( 39:31 ):

You want to be a rebel? You want to be a hippie? You want to stick it to the man? Show up on your college campus and try calling yourself a conservative.

Speaker 7 ( 39:39 ):

America's going to reach heights that it has never seen before. The future is going to be amazing.

Speaker 8 ( 39:53 ):

Don't you want healthy children? Don't you want a president that's going to make America healthy again?

Speaker 9 ( 40:08 ):

I come to you today as a former Democrat. I will be a first-time Trump voter tonight.

Donald Trump ( 40:34 ):

The people dreamed this country, and it's the people who are making America great again.

Speaker 10 ( 40:50 ):

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the next president of the United States. President Donald J. Trump.

MUSIC ( 41:18 ):

And I'm proud to be an American.

( 41:18 ) Where at least I know I'm free.

( 41:18 ) And I won't forget the men who died.

( 41:18 ) Who gave that right to me.

( 41:18 ) And I'd gladly stand up next to you.

( 41:19 ) And defend Her still today. 'Cause there ain't no doubt.

( 41:33 ) I love this land.

( 41:33 ) God Bless the U.S.A.

( 41:33 ) From the lakes of Minnesota.

( 41:46 ) To the hills of Tennessee.

( 41:46 ) Across the plains of Texas.

( 41:52 ) From sea to shining sea.

( 41:56 ) From Detroit down to Houston. And New York to L.A.

( 42:03 ) Where's pride in every American heart.

( 42:06 ) And it's time we stand and say.

( 42:06 ) That I'm proud to be an American.

( 42:06 ) Where at least I know I'm free.

( 42:06 ) And I won't forget the men who died.

( 42:06 ) Who gave that right to me.

( 42:06 ) And I'd gladly stand up next to you.

( 42:06 ) And defend Her still today.

( 42:06 ) 'Cause there ain't no doubt.

( 42:06 ) I love this land.

( 42:06 ) God Bless the U.S.A.

( 42:06 ) And I'm proud to be an American.

( 42:06 ) Where at least I know I'm free.

( 42:06 ) And I won't forget the men who died.

( 42:06 ) Who gave that right to me.

( 42:06 ) And I'd gladly stand up next to you.

( 42:06 ) And defend Her still today.

( 42:06 ) 'Cause there ain't no doubt.

( 42:06 ) I love this land.

( 42:06 ) God Bless the U.S.A.

Donald Trump ( 43:57 ):

Hello, beautiful, beautiful North Carolina. This is really the end of a journey, but a new one we'll be starting, and that's the one we've wanted to partake in, which is basically to make America great again. And now we'll have a chance to do it after today. Hopefully, everything will work out well. We're way leading. All we have to do is close it out. We have to close it out. If we get our vote, there's nothing they can do. This is one of those deals. If we get our vote… We're leading every swing state, which is unheard of for the Republican Party. They're always up at the end. They always were. Good finishes or bad finishes, depending. Sometimes they'd get there, but you'd always go in by losing hundreds of thousands of votes and you'd watch it like a racehorse. And sometimes they'd get there and sometimes they wouldn't. But with North Carolina, I always got there because we won every race, every [inaudible 00:45:02]. So essentially they have an expression, I hate the expression actually, but it's ours to lose. Does that make sense to you? It's ours to lose. If we get everybody out and vote, there's not a thing they can do. And if we don't, and if we don't, they have to get every person that ever signed anything in that horrendously dangerous party that's going to destroy our country. And it already is destroying our country. We just can't let that happen. We cannot let that happen. So here's my only purpose in even being here today. Get out and vote. You know that. I'm thrilled to be back in this beautiful state with thousands of proud, hardworking American patriots. That's what you are. You're patriots. You built this country. You built this country. But I'd like to begin by asking a very simple question, are you better off now than you were four years ago?

( 46:12 ) And I've asked that question so many times. I've never had one hand go up for the other. With you vote tomorrow, I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals coming into our country, which I happen to think is the absolute worst thing that has ever happened to our country. I've never seen it. They're putting in murderers, releasing all of their prisoners from jails all over the world, not South America, all over the world into our country. I think it's the worst thing. In the polling, when I see the polling, I see that inflation and the economy are number one, which is sort of standard, but I really would like to put that because we're going to close up that border so fast. We're going to get those people [inaudible 00:47:02]

( 47:01 ) And she's not going to do it. She couldn't do it if she wanted to. She wouldn't know what to do.

Speaker 11 ( 47:10 ):

I love you, Trump.

Donald Trump ( 47:11 ):

They have open borders. And you know what? If things went bad today and tomorrow, you would have open borders the first day of that, and you'll have… They have 21 million people that they led into our country. Many of these people are murderers. Think of it. 13, 099 are murderers, the big drug lords, the prison population from countries all over the world that if I ran a country, I'd say get in my prisons, open borders, they just walk in. No vetting. Think of it. No vetting. We have no idea who they are. You're not allowed to ask. You're not allowed to ask. They just walk right into our country and they kill people. You have murders. So you if 13,099 murders, many of them have killed far more than one person. Bad things are going to happen.

( 48:01 ) And you have terrorists at levels that we've never seen before. We had terrorists down the lowest we've… I had, in 2019… And this isn't done by me. This is done by border patrol, which by the way, endorsed me. They gave me a great endorsement. They said, "He's the greatest president ever. He's the greatest president." The head guy, Boyd Paul was great. He made a beautiful speech, but he said, "He's the greatest president our country has ever had." I said, "Does that include Lincoln, Washington, and a couple of [inaudible 00:48:34]?" But it's very nice, but they gave me the strongest endorsement. And I have to say this, at the same little speech, they said she's the worst thing to ever happen to our country. And it's very hard for them to say that. She never made one phone call in four years to the border patrol. "How are we doing?" I used to drive him crazy. They probably said, "Oh no, it's the president again." "Yes. Yes, we're fighting, our president. Yes."

( 49:00 ) I used to drive him nuts. When I had nothing to do, I said, "Call the border patrol." And we got…. Just drop that chart, please, my all time favorite chart. My all time favorite chart. I love that chart. I sleep with that chart. I kiss it every night before I go because I wouldn't be here if it weren't for the chart. If you take a look at the arrow on the bottom, that was the day I left office. That was the lowest illegal immigration we ever had. And I kept it pretty good. And then you take a look, and we had Mexico pay for their soldiers. They didn't want to pay for their soldiers. I said, "You have to give us soldiers while we build the wall." And they paid so much money to us. And they said, "We're not going to do that." They actually laughed at me when I suggested it. And I said, "Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to put a tariff of 100% on all your cars and everything that comes into the United States."

( 50:06 ) They said… You know what they said, "Sir, we would be greatly honored to let you have our soldiers free of charge, thousands. How many would you need, sir?" I said, "As many as it takes." And they were great. They made a big contribution to our security, let me tell you. But they got to stop with… Now we're talking Turkey. One of the first calls I'm going to make is to Mexico, you stop letting people come in through our border and come in through your southern border, and you stop it. Because Mexico… And I had a great relationship with the President, but he retired now. He left. He was a good man. He was a socialist.

( 50:54 ) You can't have everything, but he was a good man. But they paid a fortune for the soldiers along the border. We were able to have great numbers. Well, built 571 miles of wall. I was going to add 200 more, by the way, far more than I said. I was talking about 200, 250. We built 571, and nobody talks about it. And you know what I did? Because we had a Congress that was not behaving, I said, "I don't care. This is an invasion of our country. I'm taking it out of the military." And I took it out of the military because I gave them $725 billion. I say, "Congratulations, fellas. I'm taking out 10." "What is it for, sir?" It's called a wall because we're being invaded by Mexico.

( 51:49 ) But now we have a new president in Mexico, supposed a very nice woman, they say. I haven't met her. And I'm going to inform her, on day one or sooner, that if they don't stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I'm going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send in to the United States of America. And the reason I delayed that is… You are the first ones I've told it to. Congratulations, North Carolina. And it's only got a 100% chance of working. Because if that doesn't work, I'll make it 50. And if that doesn't work, I'll make it 75 for the tough guys. And I'll make it 100. Then I'll make it 100. And at some point, they'll have so many soldiers on their southern border. Their southern border is where they come in. They come right through.

( 52:56 ) And by the way, it has 100% chance of working. It's only a question… I'll start off at 25%. That's a lot. Do you know Mexico's our number one trading partner? Do you know what that costs? They make a fortune. They've taken over our country in a way since this Biden-Harris people. They became our number one trading partner, and they're ripping us off left and right. It's ridiculous. They're not going to rip us off. They wanted $3 billion to meet with Biden. They wouldn't have said that with me. I would've said, "Oh really? You want 3 billion to meet?" I'd do the opposite. " If you don't give us 3 billion, I'll impose the biggest fricking tax…"

( 53:40 ) I've never told you any of this, and I wanted to wait till the day because I don't want to have her… She's a low IQ individual. I don't want to have her say, "I had an idea last night while I was sleeping, turning, tossing, sweating, because I sleep, I turn, and I toss, and I sweat. I sleep like… I don't even sleep." I've gone through 62 days without a day off, every single day. And you know what? She takes a day off every other day. Last week, she makes a terrible little… She has these press conferences that last for about two minutes, and then she takes the day off. When you're running for the president of the United States and you want to do it because you have to fix the country… That's the way I'm doing. Otherwise, I wouldn't do it. I could be at the most gorgeous beaches in the world right now, but I'd much rather be with you people because you people are… I like you people better.

( 54:44 ) I'd much rather be with you. No, I would. No, I would. We're doing something historic. You know what we're doing? This has never been done before. They'll never have rallies like this. We went to Milwaukee the other night. And we're doing great in Wisconsin, by the way. We could have filled that arena. What do they have? 28,000 seats, including the floor fully packed. We could have filled that arena three times, maybe four times. The people outside, thousands and thousands of people. There's never going to be that. In four years, you're going to have a candidate, Republican, Democrat candidate, and they're going to come to North Carolina, and they're going to say, "How many are there?" And the consultants back there that make a fortune because they think they bring these people… They don't bring. Nobody brings anything. We bring them. We together bring them. But you know what they're going to say? And the same people they'll be represent… Very smart people. They're very good people. Can't give them too much leash. We can't give them too much, but they're going to have 250 people come, and that's standard.

( 55:52 ) See the ladies of North Carolina? They've come. They've come. Those beautiful, beautiful ladies, they're looking better and better all the time. These beautiful ladies… And I think they're very well to do. They're always so beautiful, beautifully quaffed. Look at that. But here's what I love. They're great Americans. They love our country. They love North Carolina. They come from North… Isn't it nice where you can sort of be closer? They'll travel to California. If I went to Hawaii, they'd be in Hawaii. I think they're loaded. You want to know the truth? I think their husbands… The reason I never see their husbands is because they're working like hell. These wives are traveling all over the place. They've been at 257 rallies, and their husbands are going to be so happy when this ends. But I don't want… And you know exactly what I'm saying. I didn't want to say this about what I'm going to do at the border. I stopped at the biggest auto plant in the world from being built on the border. China, and I have a lot of respect for China.

( 57:14 ) Look, they're smart as hell. They get angry when I say it, the fake news. They're smart as hell. They're like playing chess and grand masters against playing an average checker player and maybe a less than average checker player. The deals, when I came into office, I've never seen such bad deals with Japan, with China, the worst trade deals. I actually said there's only two reasons we could have deals so bad. The people making the deals were corrupt, which I actually believe, or they were very stupid. And I think you had a combination of both. And we fixed a lot of those deals. We would've had them all fixed up, but then we had to fix COVID. But we had the greatest… Think of it. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country, the greatest. We had the greatest border. That's done by border patrol. That's not a Trump special. That's done by border patrol. That lovely, gorgeous… I look at it, I get tears in my eyes.

( 58:21 ) And the day of that horrible situation in Butler, it was just about there. It's weird that you have it almost… Because it's usually all over the place. You have no idea where it's coming up. When I say lift up the sign, I usually have to look all over. I have one over there. But that graph is so meaningful because of… But even if the numbers were bad, I would still kiss it just equally. But those are the best numbers in the history of the border. And then look, it was like an Elon Musk rocket ship went up. They announced they were going to open the borders. I thought they were kidding. I built 200 miles of rail. And this is what border patrol wanted. I wanted to have concrete plank like in a parking lot, straight up and down the air, but you wouldn't get vision. And concrete is not as strong in terms of steel. They have very strong specifications. They wanted to have steel, hardened steel, very hard to cut.

( 59:21 ) Then they wanted to have very powerful high-number concrete. It's a very hard concrete, and then they wanted to have rebar at the highest level of steel strength in the middle. Because it's very hard to cut. It's like it can be done if you're really good, but it's very hard. And then they wanted to have a anti-climb panel on top. I hate it. I hate the anti-climb. I said, "I don't like it. It's so beautiful without that panel." I said, "Don't make me do that, sir." It's an anti-climb panel and it's called that for a reason. And we actually had testers. We had guys, two guys that climbed Mount Everest. I said, "They should qualify."

( 59:59 ) But you know who the best were? We had drug runners. These guys are unbelievable. They went up that thing like it was nothing with 75 pounds of drugs on their back. Drug runners, they were beating the Mount Everest… Well, it's a different profession after all. But they were right. That anti-climb panel stops them cold. They couldn't get over the anti-climb. So I said, "Let's do it. Let's do it." But we built 200 miles of additional, and all they had to do is put it up. The hard work was done. They were built. It was delivered. And the hard work was done. Highest specification cost more money than what I would've done, but what I would've done… They have acids that actually melt concrete. They have certain acids that you put down. Those planks would've come down very easy. These guys are ingenious. If they would spend their brains on good, everything in the world would be nice. No, they're genius, the way they smuggle drugs into our country. You got to see the cars. They build cavities in engines.

( 01:01:07 ) So you're inspecting a car, they have them in hubcaps that even if you take the hubcap, you can't find them. It's like a double hubcap. It's the craziest thing. If they would spend that genius on doing good for their country or for us, we would have no problem. It's really incredible. And the people that do the trafficking, what they do with the women is… They put them in trunks of cars. It's mostly women, by the way, mostly women. A lot of people say traveling and trafficking, but the trafficking is women. And the reason is… It's become as big as the drugs, and the reason is because of the internet. The internet made it a modern business and a big business. And I'll tell you, some of these guys, among the richest people in the world and they run a real operation.

( 01:01:58 ) And they essentially take care of Kamala because they even have an app where they can call so they learn where they can drop people that they're putting into the country, where they can come through with drugs. They have an app. Can you believe you call an app? You're now a drug trafficker or a human trafficker, and you say, ding, ding, ding, "Hello. Where do I drop these people?" "Go about seven miles up and then go a mile left and just drop them at the opening in the gate." "Okay, thank…" Can you believe this? This is Kamala. So all that stuff ends very quickly. We'll get that thing built. But they could have put up 200 miles… Oh, you know what they did with that expensive stuff? And it's expensive. They had it laying in the sand, laying in the mud. It was all there to be put up. All they had to do is flip it up. It goes like… They put it up real fast, three weeks, the whole thing.

( 01:03:03 ) We would've had 750 miles a wall. Think of it. And boy, walls work. Walls work and wheels work. They never get obsolete, right? The computers, in about two minutes, they're obsolete. But we have the best computer guy there is, right? We have Elon, and he loves it. And you know where Elon is right now, Elon is right now? He's in Pennsylvania campaigning because he thinks it's the single most important thing he's ever worked on, Elon Musk. And we want to thank him. He's an amazing guy. When I saw rocket came down, when I saw that sucker come down, 22 stories, by the way… People think it's like five feet high. It's 22 stories. That sucker's coming down and those engines were blowing. He says, "It's all computers. It's true, that thing."

( 01:03:58 ) I said, "Oh man, it's going to crash. [inaudible 01:04:00] it's going right into the gantry, right? It's going to crash." And then the engines, the fire starts blowing the bottom left. The whole bottom left is blowing, and it just pushed it. And then it came down. And those two big arms, you saw the arms, they grabbed that thing like you grab your beautiful baby. See, I've gotten much better. Years ago, I would've said something else, but I've learned. You have to learn. I would've been a little bit more risqué. Like you grab your child, you grab your child and put it in place. And I called Elon. I said, "Was that you?" "Yes." And I said, "That's genius." He said, "Yeah, a lot of brain power. Went into that."

( 01:04:48 ) I said, "Why do you do that?" He said, "Well, we don't want to drop a ship in the ocean every time it goes, and you have to start all over. Those things cost billions of dollars." He said, "This way, we save them." I said, "Can Russia do that?" "No." " Will they be able to?" "No, not for a long time." "What about China?" "No." We opened up space command. We did the whole thing. If we didn't do that, we'd be way, way behind. Space Force, Space Force, one of the many… We did so many things with the tax cuts, the regulation cuts, right to try for those people that are terminally ill. You get the right to try our medicines here instead of going to Asia and Europe, or if you have no money, going home, which is about 99% have no money and they go home.

( 01:05:39 ) But the few people that have the kind of money you need for that, they'd go to Europe, they'd go to Asia. And we have the best labs in the world, and nobody ever talks about… They tried to get it for 50 years. I got it done, passed through Congress. You think anything's easy to get passed through those guys? It's not easy. But we did so many things, and we've saved thousands and thousands of lives. It's worked out unbelievably. And nobody wanted it. The scientists didn't want it because they're terminally ill. They don't want to start from a terminally ill person. Looks bad on the record. They didn't want record sheets. Insurance companies hated it. It was very, very… I got everybody into a room. Our country hated it because our country will get sued. When somebody's terminally ill, they die, and they sue the country. I said, "You can't do that."

( 01:06:21 ) I got everybody in the room and I signed an agreement. I had everybody agreed that we're going to work beautifully with people that are terminally ill, but they're not going to be allowed to sue anybody. If they die, they die. And if they live, it's going to be the greatest… We have saved thousands of people, and nobody ever talks about it. Nobody ever talks about… Thousands and thousands. We have a person in this room who was saved by right to try where a space age drug doing things, but it takes a long time to get them approved. Well, I cut it in half. I cut that time in half, but the FDA takes 12 years sometimes to get something. And by the time it's approved, a lot of people are gone.

( 01:07:09 ) So when they're terminally ill, we get them that drug right away. And they sign, they sign an agreement that I or my family will not ever, for any reason, and under any circumstance, sue the United States government, such and such a drug maker, such and such a lab, Dr. Schwartz, Dr. Jones. We will not sue anybody. We just want to get better." That's all it says. Pretty good, right? That's pretty good for only a semi non-lawyer. But that's essentially what it says. And the funny thing is the ones that were most against it, were the drug companies in the labs. We have the greatest labs in the world. We're doing space age things, and we got it started. It was dying on the limb before I came along. Well, NASA was dead. When I came along,

Donald Trump ( 01:08:00 ):

… what you're seeing with the space and NASA was dead. NASA had grass growing out of its runways. I mean, every time there was a crack, you had grass. This place was dead. Now it's the most vibrant center anywhere in the world. All of their centers, it's vibrant. And Elon brought it back and the people at NASA are doing a great job. They're all working together. They're all working together. But we brought it back. And ultimately we want to go to Mars and all but what I want it for is defense and Russia and China were killing us in space. And space is so important, it's going to end up being maybe, I don't want to say more important than the Marines because they'll never speak to me again, but I'll tell you what, it is going to be right up there in terms of importance, as important.

( 01:08:46 ) If we didn't have it… We were being lapped by China. They have stuff up there. And Russia, even though they're a little bit busy killing a lot of people… A war that would've never taken place. Zero chance. I speak to Vladimir Putin a lot. It was the apple of his eye. "Don't do it. Don't do it." I mean, I closed up his pipeline. It was dead, Nord Stream 2. Biden came in and he allowed it to go, but he closed up the Keystone XL pipeline. Think of that. I said, "No, Joe, you got it wrong. You let Keystone go forward and you close up the Russian pipeline." But he did. He did the opposite. And then they said, "Oh, Trump loves Russia. Trump loves Russia." It's the biggest project they've ever had. I close it up. Then he came in, the first day he was there, he let them build it. So what is that? Oh, that sounds so cute. I love dogs. I love dogs. We love dogs.

( 01:09:56 ) Lara Trump, by the way, you happen to know, she is married to my son and she's the vice chairman along with Michael. They're doing an incredible job. But she would come into the office and she loves dogs and pets, and she would get me to do things for doggies that you wouldn't believe. "Dad, we have to make the cages larger. We have to provide air conditioning." Can you believe? I didn't know too much about it, but you understand what I'm saying, in these kennels where they're obviously not treated too good? I said, "So do we have to give them a steam bath or do have…?" Lisa, no, she was very, very strong. And I did all of… I listen to her. When she talks, I listen. But Lara was so incredible. As you know, she was born in North Carolina. Lived here her whole life, and even Ted Budd, who's doing an incredible job.

( 01:11:01 ) And I said, "Ted, run for the Senate." And he said, "I'll do it, but I'm only going to do it if Lara's not going to run." Is that right? He said, "I'm only doing it if Lara…" And she said, "I've devoted so much time and I'm raising these beautiful children. I have a great husband. And Ted is great." She said that. She said, "You have a great guy in Ted, very nice." But he did say that. A lot of people would say, "They'll bowl through…" Nobody would've had a chance. She's very… They love her. They love her in the party. They love her… Even the Democrats love her. Can you believe it? Stand up, Ted. Stand up.

( 01:11:43 ) And he's doing a great job. But I thought that was really nice. And she knew he would do a great job. Tomorrow, you have to stand up and tell Kamala that you've had enough, you can't take anymore. You just… What? They're all screaming, "Fire, please…" I mean, she's… What a terrible job, what they have done to our country! And you're going to say that to her. You're going to say, "You've done a terrible job. You're grossly incompetent. We're not going to take it anymore. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out. Get the hell out of here. You're out of here. Get out of here." That's what you'll say.

( 01:12:53 ) Thank you very much. So with your vote, we're going to win North Carolina, we're going to defeat Kamala, and we're going to make America great again. I hope you don't mind that that entire opening… You know I was going to get out of here fast. I'm doing four of these things today. They're big, and the voice is holding up just about barely. But I had to express it. You have been a very special group to me because I've won every… I've never lost a primary. I've never lost… In North Carolina, I've won everything. I won those elections. I've made all these friends. So I'll just give you a little bit of a thing. And by the way, the press will say, "Oh, he rambled." No, that's not rambling. You know what that is? That was genius. That's the weave. Now see, I wove, frankly, the rest of it. I don't really even have to talk about it. But that was the ultimate weave. And think of it. Isn't it nice that you can have a president that doesn't need to use a teleprompter?

( 01:14:10 ) Isn't it nice? And I got to go a little quicker now because you know what? I took Marco's place and I took Sarah Huckabee Sanders place. I said, "Do you mind if I go now? Because you know what? We got to keep the schedule." And I'm going to ask them to come up right now, just come up, because I took their place and it's so rude. Marco is a big winner, beautiful winner from Florida, as you know. He is a great guy. He's my friend, and Sarah is now the governor of Arkansas, and we love those people in Arkansas. So while I'm talking, I'm going to ask them to come. We're trying to conserve a little time, but they are incredible people. Oh, come on up if you can, if you're around, wherever, come on. That's called efficiency. I figure Sarah would be finished now, and Marco would just about be getting started. Two great friends, two very talented. No, but I figured Sarah would just about now be finishing and Marco would be starting. And he's a great speaker. They're both great speakers. They speak for a long time, and I'd be sitting in the back, I'd say, "Get them off the stage." So they were so nice, and I'm going to just ask them to each say a little bit and we are then going to make our next stop. Come on. Thank you.

Alina Habba ( 01:15:38 ):

Good morning. It is an honor to share the stage with America's best and favorite president and soon to be our next president again. We've never had a president who fights more, who fights harder, and loves this country the way that Donald J. Trump does, and that's why we need him back in the White House. Every day when the left was relentlessly attacking me, it was Donald Trump who stood up for me, who empowered me, and gave me confidence to do my job. And that's what he does for every single American every single day. He will not let us down. Make sure you get out and vote, North Carolina. We need you because America needs Donald Trump, and we're going to make it happen. Thank you so much for all you're doing.

Speaker 12 ( 01:16:49 ):

We took a… Thank you. Thank you. Wow. Unfortunately, our country took a wrong turn four years ago, and now we're stuck in a malaise. Everything is bad news. Our border is broken. We're not respected in the world. Hardworking men and women have been forgotten and left behind. Our allies don't trust us and our enemies don't fear us. We are tired of living in a country that is no longer dreaming big. But that is going to change tomorrow, and you're going to help change it. Tomorrow North Carolina and the country are going to make our 45th president our 47th president, and with Donald Trump back in the White House, together we will dream big again for this country. We will be a country that once again is proud of its history, excited about its future, because together with Donald Trump, we are going to make America not just great, but greater than it has ever been before. Thank you.

Donald Trump ( 01:18:28 ):

So they both did better… If they stood up here and spoke each for half an hour, what they just did was better and appreciated and brings us a little bit into schedule. One thing, Marco was talking, and I said, "You got hit so hard by that hurricane, and we cared only…" We didn't care about what we're doing today. We only cared about saving lives, and we did a good job. FEMA did a horrible job. The administration, they're still not there. You know why? Because they've spent all their money on bringing in murderers and a lot of people. They spent all their money on bringing in illegal migrants. They've also taken a lot of your jobs, especially jobs from the black population. But think of this, when I started having to think about North Carolina a little bit in terms of a thing called the election, I said to our people back there who have been fantastic, Chris, Susie, everybody, I said, "We got a problem because North Carolina's reliable for me. I mean, I've never lost there, never lost."

( 01:19:34 ) And I don't think we're going to start now. I don't think… I've never lost and we have a beautiful lead right now in early voting. Last time I wasn't leading in the first. I won her twice, but I was way behind. In fact, I went to my people. I said, "Hey, man, I'm way behind here. What's going on, Michael?" What was it, like 200,000 votes? I said, "How the hell do I win them?" But the later voting came in, Republican. Boom, and we blew them away. He was right. He said, "Just relax. Just relax."

( 01:20:05 ) I'm screaming, "What the hell happened in North…? What happened in North Carolina?" But that's the way it works. I mean, the Republicans are used to voting late. They do it. They feel better about it. They want to be there on Tuesday, and that's all we want them to do is do the same thing that they've done. But I have to say, an amazing thing happened because I went down… I had to be the first, but first, I went close, but I didn't want to bother people. I mean, it was devastating. And then shortly thereafter, I went to the sites and it was horrible. The houses were ripped. People are still missing. Many people died. A lot of people don't know. You've had terrible FEMA response, like non-existence. Franklin Graham was great, and so many other people were great.

( 01:20:47 ) And I made a big contribution toward the effort. But I said, "Rather than me do…" I was ready to do it, but I said, "I'll give it to Franklin and others that are doing so well. That's amazing, some of the people that work there." So we gave them a lot of money and they're doing a job, but no response. But you know what? I said to Michael and I said to other people, "These people have been wiped out. Their houses are gone." You had to see… I mean, trees are ripped… Giant trees, 10 foot in diameter, they're ripped out like they were toothpicks. I've never seen anything like it. And just clean. Not only are the houses gone, but the concrete foundations were taken out. You'd see them laying 20 miles down the road. It was the most devastating that you can imagine. I said, "We'll be lucky…"

( 01:21:36 ) And this was a very Trump area. We know what that means. It's Trump, Trumpy. They call it a Trumpy area with a lot of love and great people. No crime, no nothing, just great people. But it was devastated, essentially destroyed. You'll probably have it built back in about 15 minutes because the way you are, workers. But I said, "If we get 50% of the vote, I don't know… They're not going to show up." So I figured anywhere… Not having done this business that long actually, I figured very accurately, anywhere from 25 to 50% of the people may come and vote. And here's what happened. The lines were through the roof. I don't know where the hell you all came from.

( 01:22:17 ) We had a man and woman standing in line, good-looking couple, but the man's shirt had mud on it and the woman was cloaked… I mean it was… I said, "Man, look at this." And they're standing in line, getting ready to vote. And it was a long line too. And you broke the all-time record for North Carolina early voting. I've never seen anything… I've never seen… So we love you. Look, this is why our country's great, and it's people like you. It's really, really amazing. Over the past four years, Kamala has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal that any leader in American history has ever inflicted upon its people. She has violated her oath, eradicated our sovereign border, and unleashed an army of gangs and criminal migrants from prisons and jails and insane asylums and mental institutions all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo in Africa, stealing countless American lives.

( 01:23:38 ) They're killing people. They're killing people at will. Only days ago, a illegal alien from North… And this was a rough one, just happened. You know that. An illegal alien from North Africa who Kamala led into our country with her horrendous open border, just a dangerous, horrendous situation, traveled to a Jewish neighborhood in Chicago and tried to execute a Jewish man on the street, shooting him in the back as he walked to synagogue. He then opened fire on police and paramedics, shooting an ambulance before police returned fire and ended his rampage fairly quickly. And by the way, our police have got to be respected. We have to give their dignity back. We can't take their pensions, their house, their family. They want to stop crime. We have to let them stop crime. We have to give them their dignity and their honor back. In July, an illegal alien who Kamala released into our country again with her open border… "Just walk right through, sir."

( 01:24:48 ) Did he do anything wrong? And they could look… The guys from ICE, they're great. And they could look at somebody and they can say where he is from, what he did, how many people did he kill? And they don't like what they're doing. They have a much easier job doing what they're doing right now, but they want to stop people and they want to get them out, or they want to put them in jail. Some are so bad you can't actually let out. If you did, it would actually be dangerous just to bring them back to their countries. Their countries weren't accepting them back until I came. With Barack Hussein Obama… I call him the great divider. He's the great divider. And he hit… Oh, and Michelle hit me the other… I was so nice to her. Out of respect, I was so nice. She hit me the other day. I was going to say to my people, "Am I allowed to hit her now?" They said, "Take it easy, sir. Sir, take it…" My geniuses, I'm telling you, they said, "Just take it easy."

( 01:25:46 ) "Oh, what do you mean? She said bad about me. I can't hit back?" "Sir, you are winning. Just relax." Is that good or bad advice? I think it's neutral. You know what the response is there? It's like, "Nah." What do the ladies from North Carolina think about…? Hit back or just relax? Oh, they say hit back. You say hit back. I'd actually love to hit back, but we'll hold it a little while. We'll hold it. I'd love to hit back, but… Oh, no, no. She took some shots at me the other day. I said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. What have we here? I've never heard that before." I've always treated her very nicely. But he's the great divider. Barack Hussein Obama, he's a great divider, but he never did… He came out same way for Hillary. How did that work out? Oh. And here's news that's breaking today. Sleepy Joe Biden has announced officially that he likes Trump more than he likes Kamala.

( 01:26:55 ) And he actually hates my guts. But he likes Trump more than he likes… Oh, he hates her. They walked into the office. He just got 14 million votes. He voted for me. That's one of the ladies from North Carolina. He voted for… She said he voted for me. He probably did, yeah. Be an interesting… They got to follow them in with a camera, why not? They spied on my campaign. So why the hell couldn't you do that? But Sleepy Joe said, "I don't want to leave." You're leaving, Joe. This was crazy Nancy. She's such a bad one. She's already plotting a move to try and impeach him. She's a bad, sick woman. She's crazy as a bedbug. She is a crazy… Remember what? Remember she ripped up the paper behind me? She could have gone to jail for that. You're not allowed to do that. I think Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace. They impeached me on no evidence. I did nothing wrong. Fortunately, the Republicans stood up for me a hundred percent. But Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace. The hatred she brings… She's got real hatred. And yet she couldn't sell a stock like Visa last week. And the following day, they announced a major investigation into Visa, but she got out. And the fake news back there does nothing about it. They should be ashamed. And by the way, just to get it straight, because there'll be reports… It's already probably out over the wires. I shouldn't have done it. I'm only kidding about Joe. He didn't officially say that, but I believe, okay? It's probably already out on the wires that, "We have an official report from…" Because this is pretty big stuff up here so when I say it's official, no, no, I'm only kidding.

( 01:29:09 ) In July, an illegal alien who Kamala released into our country was arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina for stalking a woman into a public bathroom and attempting to forcibly rape her. In Wilmington, North Carolina three months ago, an illegal from Venezuela brutally stabbed a man to death just four days after he was arrested for domestic violence. But instead of being deported, this criminal alien was released so he can kill. And that's what he did. These terrible atrocities are happening every day in our cities and towns. They're going after young girls, they're going after old men. They're going after anybody that moves. They don't care and you know, different from us, the moment they kill, they don't even think about it. We don't kill. But can you imagine if something happened? It would be devastating. They don't even think. They wake up the next morning and they don't even think about the damage and the havoc and the ruin they've caused families and the pain.

( 01:30:13 ) And these are coming back. These people are coming into our country at levels that have never been seen in any country. No Third World country would allow it. They'd stand at that border with sticks and stones and say, "You're not coming in here." I want you to hear directly from a mother whose world has been shattered because Kamala let savage, illegal alien murderers into our country. Please.

Speaker 13 ( 01:30:39 ):

Sunday night, I asked her to not stay up super late because of her coming to work with me in the morning, first to do her summer school. She said okay. I told her, "Good night, and I love you." I went to bed not realizing that that was going to be the last time I saw her. We're best friends. I'm going shake it again. I woke up to notice she wasn't in her bed. I am in my heart, trying not to lose my mind because I don't know where she is. I finally remembered her phone had a location on and her phone was pinging just two minutes down the road, right behind the skate park. I start driving to the direction the phone was being pinged at and I see a couple cop cars with lights on. I see yellow tape, and immediately my heart drops and sinks to the bottom of my stomach. My daughter's hands and ankles were both bound. She was strangled to death, left with no pants. And I know in my heart she fought incredibly hard. She was not going down without a fight.

Speaker 14 ( 01:32:06 ):

We begin with two men we're learning are charged with capital murder tonight, accused of killing a twelve-year-old girl.

Speaker 15 ( 01:32:12 ):

Police say these men strangled her before dumping her into that creek. Both men were in the country illegally.

Speaker 16 ( 01:32:17 ):

Apprehended, then released by border patrol less than three weeks before Jocelyn's death. The men accused of killing Jocelyn Nungaray are affiliated with the gang known for brutal violence.

Speaker 13 ( 01:32:29 ):

Kamala Harris was in charge of immigration and our borders. If we had better border policies and not open borders and not these catch-and-release policies, I truly believe this all could have been prevented. Under her being vice president of this country, my daughter's life was ripped away from her. She had her entire life… I've had her… Happy birthday, dear Jocelyn. My daughter is six feet in the ground based off of policies that she allowed to keep. Kamala Harris did have one job, and she not only failed… Not me, she failed my daughter. She failed Jocelyn. She was only 12. President Trump reached out, gave me his sincerest condolences as not a former president, just as a father, someone who cares. I believe Donald Trump needs to be back in office. I can at least know that my next child will be safe in this country.

Donald Trump ( 01:33:52 ):

Very sad. That was a few days ago that we had the news announcement, and it was the day when the border patrol endorsed me so strongly, and I was so honored by it. And we talked about Jocelyn. She was there and talked about Jocelyn. I mean, just so unnecessary. It would've never happened. He would've have been able to get into the country. It would've never happened. So many things wouldn't have happened. Inflation wouldn't have happened. Russia, Ukraine wouldn't have happened. Israel wouldn't have happened. The October 7th Israel attack would've never happened. Those people would all be alive. Most of them are gone, I believe. I think that's part of the reason they're not wanting to negotiate so much. They said, "Oh, I can't believe it." They're probably… Most of those hostages, sadly, it's… I think they're possibly gone. Most of them are gone. And it would've never happened. That attack would've never happened. All those people would be alive.

( 01:34:53 ) And the Afghanistan, the greatest embarrassment in the history of our country, I believe. They took the soldiers out first. You have to take the soldiers out last. It's very simple. Milley should have been fired, all those generals. Kelly was such a disaster. Some people are good. Some people are not good. Some people are stupid. But who would think that you take the soldiers out first? Mattis made big mistakes. But remember this about our military. We defeated ISIS and I got you into no wars because we had great people. I had mostly great people. We had mostly great people. And when I went to Washington, I didn't know anybody. I was a New York guy. I was only there 17 times according to the media.

( 01:35:44 ) And I went to Washington and I said, "Listen, I just became president, but I don't know anybody." And you rely on very good people. Some are RINOs, and they're decent RINOs too, but they give you RINOs back. And we don't like the RINOs. We don't think they do the job properly. But we did a phenomenal job. I just want to say that the day that I take office, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer. November 5th, 2024 will be Liberation Day in America.

( 01:36:38 ) And on day one, I will launch the largest deportation of criminal program in American history. And a president named Dwight Eisenhower, great general, a better president than people were saying actually, but he believed in strong borders. He hated to see people come through our border. And he has the record right now but I suspect that record… Unfortunately. It's not something I want to do. But we have no choice. We can't allow murderers and drug dealers and all these people. They're all pouring into our country, and we can't allow it. We won't have a country left. I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered. They've been conquered. Our towns have been… You take a look at Aurora. Take a look at Springfield. We have a town of 50,000 people and they drop 30,000 illegal migrants. They used a little technicality, so we don't call them… But to me, that's illegal. In any event, there's no way a town can subsist. You have hospitals where people who go for a checkup can't get checkups anymore. The whole place is being flooded. And they come from largely a troubled country, a very troubled country, very dangerous country, but a very troubled country. And they have another little problem. They don't speak a word of English. So the mayor, who's a nice guy, is looking for interpreters. This isn't what we're all about. 30,000 people going to a 50,000… People down Springfield… Springfield, Ohio, no problems. We had a beautiful little town. And now it's horrible. And this is happening, all of… Those are examples. Aurora… In Colorado, you have a radical left lunatic governor that has no idea what the hell he is doing.

( 01:38:37 ) Colorado should vote for me because of what they put me through. They tried to take me off the ballot when I was leading both the Republican and Democrat parties, and it went to the Supreme Court of the United States. And in a unanimous decision, they say, "I'm sorry. You're going to have to beat him at the polls. You're going to have to beat him at the polls." And hopefully they're not going to be able to win. And the people of Colorado… You know who is more angry about that than the Republicans? The Democrats, the regular Democrats. And I think we have a chance of… I hope that Colorado's watching now, and I think we have a chance of winning Colorado because of what they did. You talk about democracy, that was a threat to democracy. See, that was a real threat to democracy.

( 01:39:21 ) And we will put the vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in a jail. We'll kick them out of the country. We'll take care of it. But to expedite removals of Tren de Aragua and other savage gangs like MS13… We have a lot of gangs. They're bad ones. They're tough, tough people. Thank goodness, we have ICE and border patrol, and we have great law enforcement. We have great, great law enforcement. I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil. And if they come back into our country, it's an automatic 10 years in jail with no possibility of parole. And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.

( 01:40:26 ) And I will immediately ban all sanctuary cities. They're sanctuary for criminals in the United States of America. And to secure our border and working along with all of the things we're going to be doing, we are going to rescue our economy. Four years of Kamala has delivered nothing but economic hell for our American workers. Her inflation disaster has made life unaffordable and cost families over $30,000 in higher prices. And just days ago, we had the worst jobs report in modern history. You know that? I looked up. I said, "Thank you." Because they tried to hold it. They tried not to put the report out. Kamala said, "Don't put that report. It'll cost me the election." But the problem is the fake news doesn't want to report on it. So usually you're hearing 200,000 jobs, 300,000, sometimes like four. We had the best numbers people have ever seen. But usually you're looking at a lot of… Hundreds of thousands of jobs routinely. It's expanding, 12,000 jobs… That's a depression. 12,000 jobs were created. But that's the good news. 30,000 private

Donald Trump ( 01:42:00 ):

… Sector jobs were killed in a single month. Nearly 100,000 manufacturing jobs have been wiped out since the start of this year. 150,000 Americans joined the unemployment rolls in October, this is in one month. I always said I would never want to have a thing like this happened, and I've been saying it's going to happen because of what they're doing, because they know nothing about economics or business. Honestly, they're stupid people. We have stupid people leading our nation. And nearly 250,000 people dropped out of the labor force, they dropped out because they couldn't get a job. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine? These are the numbers and they don't want to talk about it, but that's okay. These numbers are disqualifying. These numbers make them, because the famous quote, "It's all about the economy, stupid.' We have the worst economy that we've ever had since the 1929 depression. These are depression numbers and it's going to get worse.

( 01:43:18 ) But see, they'll blame it on me. She just said they'll blame it on me. But you see, that's what I didn't want. I didn't want to be sworn in and then have these numbers come. I said, "I hope it comes before I go into office, otherwise I'll get blamed." I didn't want to be a certain president.

Speaker 17 ( 01:43:36 ):

You're the best president.

Donald Trump ( 01:43:39 ):

Thank you. I didn't want to be a certain president that had to preside over, he got into office and it all crashed down, people jumping off buildings, it all came. This is the beginning. Just remember this, this was an important date last week, the end of last week, remember, that was a very important time. Just think a few months ago, they fraudulently claimed 818,000 jobs were created, 818,000, and it was a fraud when in fact, there were no jobs that were created, it was all a lie, and they thought they'd be able to get away with it through the election, but there was a whistleblower, and the whistleblower couldn't stand what they were doing and blew the whistle on them, and they got caught. And now, again, they've just revised past job reports because they had another whistleblower so they had to do it. They wanted to wait until after the election again and they found another 112,000 fake jobs. In other words, jobs that they're reporting exist and they don't exist, it's a fraud. That's 1 million fake jobs. Now, when you look at the numbers and you see those jobs, it didn't make it look great, not like our years, but you know what? It made it look pretty normal, pretty good, there was no story.

( 01:45:11 ) Meanwhile, think of this, meanwhile, 100% of net jobs created in the last year have gone to migrants. Can you imagine? Not to our population, migrants, but these are depression-type numbers, and that's where we're heading if she's elected. Under my leadership, we're quickly going to turn this economic nightmare into an economic miracle, you'll see. And we're going to make America wealthy again, and we'll make America very importantly affordable again because people cannot afford the prices and prices are too high. We're just one day away from the best jobs and biggest paychecks and the brightest economic future that the world has ever seen. But you must go and vote.

( 01:46:05 ) And Kamala talks about fixing the economy, but why doesn't she do it? She always goes, "Oh yes, we're going to do this. We're going to give you tax hikes," she wants to raise people's taxes. That's how the depression started, by the way, Herbert Hoover Herbert Hoover, he raised the interest rates and the taxes at the same time and it just went boom. That's what she wants to do, she wants to increase your taxes. Interest rates are too high, they are too high. Kamala's plan will impose the largest tax hike in American history and raise taxes on the typical American family by $3,000. My plan will massively cut taxes for workers and small businesses, and we will have no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on social security. To rapidly reduce inflation, I will end Kamala's war on American energy and we will drill, baby drill. We're going to, right? And I will cut your energy prices. You have very high energy prices, I have to say. You have high energy prices and you don't have FEMA. Those people, they better get that FEMA here fast. But on January 20th, you'll see a whole different, just tell everybody to sit back, relax. January 20th you'll see people come in and help you out like we did in the past. We had great FEMA, we operated, we had a lot of hurricanes. We helped Puerto Rico more than anybody. Puerto Rico, we helped them so much. They love me and I love them. Puerto Rico. See, she loves me. She loves me and I love her too actually.

( 01:47:56 ) No, we had great FEMA. We helped Puerto Rico and other places, but at levels nobody ever saw before. We got in there, we sent hospital ships, we sent everything. They got hit hard, Puerto Rico got really hit hard a lot. They still do. And I'll cut your energy prices in one half. We have more liquid gold than any country, Russia, Saudi Arabia right there.,It's under your feet. We're going to cut your energy prices by 50% and when that happens, everything else is going to come down. That's what brought it up. Now, before leaving, I just want to introduce some people that have just been great. Senator Ted Butt you know, he's great. Congressman Dan Bishop who's running for Attorney General, and he was a great congressman and he'll be a great attorney. General. Candidates for Congress, Brad Knott and Alan Swain, they're terrific. Good luck. I heard you're doing great. Our great RNC chairman, if we don't win… I'm not going to be saying that, I'm going to take it back, okay? But I think we've got it under control. Wouldn't you say? The great Michael Watley of North Carolina we're going to win. And Michael and I have one message for you, we don't need your money, we don't need anything. We got plenty of everything. All we need is a very simple vote, just go out and vote and get your friends to vote too, bring them along.

( 01:49:38 ) And a man who I'm so proud of because he stepped into very big shoes, Michael's shoes, GOP Chair Jason Simmons. We're looking good. These guys don't let us down. I mean, I took the man from North Carolina, I moved him to the top. That's a nice statement. When all those other things were falling off a cliff, ballots have been found but this guy had 603 lawyers and we had them stymied. You don't think they would've done that here, Chair. But we have a good legal team now, we're watching them and they're watching. I think they're very upset at what we've done, but Michael has really established some power. And we just want a fair election, that's all we want.

( 01:50:32 ) A friend of mine and former Acting Attorney General, Matt Whitaker, thank you very much. Alice Johnson's here, where's Alice Johnson? Oh, look at my beautiful… Somebody came in to see me, they said, "There's a woman that's been in jail for 22 years," this is approximately, but around that number, "A beautiful woman, a great woman, everyone in prison loves her. She's like the person that everybody, she's high quality. And how much longer does she have to stay?" Another 28 years. She's been there for 22 years, the model prisoner and people called me about it, I've been hearing about her and what happened was amazing, I checked it out. I said, "Wow, that's a hell of a big sentence," for doing what people do now. And they don't even get fined, right? So she's in there for 22 years. So I got her out of prison. I said, "I'm doing it." You look beautiful, wow.

( 01:51:59 ) Can you imagine? She was actually on a phone call. They had a couple of guys selling drugs and stuff and she was on the call. They gave her 22 years plus I guess 50, 60 years or something. I mean, it's unbelievable. Today they wouldn't even give you a fine. And that's no good either, by the way, because of what's going on. But it was one of the best feelings, I mean, I've had a lot of good feelings, we had a lot of victories, I'll tell you what, but that was one of the really good feelings.

( 01:52:28 ) And then I said to Alice, "Alice," she came into the White House, said, "How many people are like you in prison, in your prison, big prison?" She said, "Many, sir." I said, "Really? Are they all that way, are they?" "No sir." And that was a good answer because I knew they weren't. If she would've said yes, then I would've said, "Well, you gave me the right answer. You don't know it." But she said, "Many, many great people." I said, "Give me a list of your top 25 or 30 or 50 or 10, whatever it is, give me a list of really good people who shouldn't be there." And she gave me a list and we got every one of them out immediately, right?

( 01:53:09 ) Just a great woman. Thank you very much. I didn't know you were going to be here, that's very nice. She still likes me. Well, she's got to like me, what the hell? I mean, could you imagine if she were like some of these guys, sometimes I'll endorse somebody and they won't be that… Can you imagine, this would be a story, I got her out of 28 years and then she comes out against me. But stuff like that happens in politics, I got to tell you. But not with that one it doesn't. We love you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

( 01:53:52 ) So I didn't even put it here, we have so much stuff and I don't want to bore you, but I was asked by a group of people, mostly African-American people, came to my office, they said, "We've been trying for 30 years to get criminal justice reform. Obama couldn't do it, nobody could do it, nobody could do it." And they came to my office and they said, "We have a problem. We're five votes short and we need five conservative senators that are hard-line." And actually we had conservative senators that loved it, we had some conservative senators that were actually supporting it.

( 01:54:36 ) But I called up some of the senators and one of them in particular was great. He said, "You got it." He was leading it. He said, "Sir, you got it." He said, "I got what? I haven't even asked you a question yet." "You're calling about criminal justice reform and I'm the one that's leading against it, right? But you got it. Because if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even be a senator. And if you feel that way, I'm giving it to you." That's the way it was, I got five guys in 10 minutes and we got it done.

( 01:55:19 ) Because I see this guy, I don't know who he is, but I see him on television, sort of a lightweight, I think, not a very smart guy. But you know what? He came in, he was one of the people that came into the office, a Black gentleman named Van Jones, right? So he came in and I was impressed with him, good-looking guy, he was crying uncontrollably that it was going to fail again. And there were like 10 African-American people and a couple of others, but mostly African-American and he was sitting right in front of me and weeping and saying, and I really thought he was great because you know what? That's okay. I mean, he is trying to get people like Alice out, that's good. And it didn't, there were no provisions for anything, it was really Draconian. And what I did is I said, "That's really nice. Look, I'm going to see if I can get this."

( 01:56:15 ) And I got it done in about two hours and we had criminal justice reform and they announced a news conference that night, Van Jones, who I don't know, the only time I think I ever met him was in the Oval Office, they came in with a group about criminal justice reform. And remember, Obama couldn't get, nobody could get it, nobody. Bush couldn't get it. They all tried. Why wouldn't they try? So what happens is he was crying profusely, I told him, "Congratulations, we're going to get it for you." And I got it. And then they announced a news conference that night in some place in Washington DC and he was heading up the news conference.

( 01:57:01 ) I said, "First Lady, come on over here. I'm going to show you something really nice. This is really a beautiful thing. I'm very happy I was able to do this. I got them the votes that they could have never gotten five conservative senators." You wouldn't have gotten these guys. You got to know what we're dealing with here. They were seriously hard right. And that's good, that's fine. You got a hard left, you got a hard right?

( 01:57:23 ) And I said, "First Lady," who people love, she's got the number one bestselling book in the country, can you believe it? Can you believe it? I wouldn't have even said that except I read it and it was really good. Can you imagine if I didn't read it and I didn't like it? No, she's great and she loves you, she says hello. But she's got the number one, that's a big achievement in life on the New York Times list. Do you know how that book has to sell 20 times more than it should in order for her to be the number one bestseller? So we're proud of her. She's great. And she was a great First Lady. People love her. People love her. And I said, "First Lady, First Lady," see, this is a little bit of a weave, you see those stories, First Lady book, boom, but you got to always bring it back. When it comes to a time when it doesn't meet at the bottom, then it's time to say, "Let's not do this anymore. We won't do this anymore."

( 01:58:24 ) But so what happened is Van Jones was crying and now I tell him it's okay, he was the happiest guy. It was beautiful. Got a nice way about him, nice look, real nice look, smart. And I heard they were going to have a big news conference to announce it later on that evening and they had it. And I said, "First Lady, come on, this is one I want you to watch." Because I wouldn't say she's in love with politics. I wouldn't say it's her first thing on the book. She not in love with politics. She says, "It's a very unfair situation." But I said, "Welcome to politics," right? But she's been so popular, she's raised so much money for people with Be Best. So I said, "Listen, you got to watch this."

( 01:59:14 ) So we sat down and we watching the news conference open and Van Jones was introducing everybody that I had never heard of any of them. "I want thank this one. I want thank that one. I want to thank Al Sharpton," the guy had nothing to do with it, nothing. He had nothing, it was just a con job. I've known Al for a long time, it's just a con job. So, "I want to thank Al Sharpton." He wants to thank all these people, I never met any of them, some were names. He was thanking Democrat senators that opposed it. He was thanking everybody. And before it started, I said, "Honey, look, we're human," I said, "Baby, when do you hear the nice things he says about me, it's unbelievable. It's going to be unbelievable. So come here because this is really bringing the country together." So she said, "Oh, that's nice." So we sat and watched.

( 02:00:12 ) And after announcing the first 10 or 12 names, she looks at me, "Do you think he's going to say anything about you?" "Yeah, I think so. Maybe he's saving me for the end. He saved the best for last." He went through so many names and he never mentioned my name. He never mentioned my name. And every time I see that guy, not that I needed it, I get enough publicity, but can you imagine that? And then they wonder about why you don't bring people together. Van Jones went through so many names that night, they were up on the stage with him and it was only done because of a guy named Donald J. Trump. And I just thought, I haven't relayed that story, but little things now I'm relieved, I don't have to carry around that. But all I know is that our beautiful Alice Johnson is out of prison and she should have never been there for that kind of a thing, or certainly not for very long. We love you Alice. It's great that you're there. We'll always be friend.

( 02:01:17 ) And just quickly, I want to also thank Steve Witkoff. He's here. He is a friend of mine, he's been traveling with me. He's one of the most successful developers and he gave a lot of money to Franklin Graham also, I want to tell you that. So Steve Witkoff, wherever Steve is, thank you Steve. And Howard Lutnick is along with an unbelievable woman, Linda McMahon, they're heading up transition. And they're going to do a great job. He's got a great story, he's been a very successful person, but he had to rebuild his firm because of the attack on the World Trade Center and lost his entire firm and then rebuilt it bigger, better, stronger. And he gave a big portion of the proceeds to the people that were killed. He lost the top three floors of the building. His firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, was on the top three floors of the World Trade Center. They were all gone including his brother. And he rebuilt that firm and it's now bigger. And he gave a big chunk, he didn't have to do that. And he's just a very highly respected man on Wall Street. And he's involved in the transition at a high level.

( 02:02:26 ) And I also would like to pay homage because they're great people, they're great people. We all like to brag about our kids and sometimes maybe we shouldn't and some people, you have your kids, you love your kids, but these are great children, great. I mean, they're not children anymore, but to me, they'll always be children, right? They're your children. If they're 25 or 35 or 40, I mean, Don is not a child, Eric is not a child, Tiffany is now going to have a beautiful baby. And Ivanka called me a little while ago, she sends her love to everybody. She's terrific.

( 02:03:15 ) And I have a guy who's at home with the First Lady and he's very smart, he got into a great college and he's now in college. He's 18 years old and he's doing great. And he gives me good advice, "Dad, just take it easy now. You just take it easy, dad, all right? You don't have to go too much here." He gives me good advice. He is very wise. And also Michael Boulos, which who's fantastic, his family is fantastic. And that's it.

( 02:03:54 ) So in conclusion, with your vote tomorrow we're going to fire Kamala, we're going to save America, and we're going to cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages and bring thousands of factories back to America and back to North Carolina. We will build America, we will buy American, we will hire American, and I will end the war in Ukraine. Should have never started. If I were president, would've never started. And in the Middle East, would've never started, Israel, all those people would be alive and I will prevent, I promise, World War III. We're very close to World War III in case you ever noticed that. We have people representing us who don't have a clue.

( 02:04:39 ) We will crush violent crime and give our police the support, protection, resources and respect that they so dearly deserve. We will strengthen and modernize our military. We will build a missile defense shield over our country, made in the USA. We will rebuild our cities, including our capital in Washington, DC, making them safe, clean, and beautiful again. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag.

( 02:05:14 ) We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women's sports. I will defend religious liberty, I will restore free speech and I will defend the right to keep and bear arms. After years of building up foreign nations, defending foreign borders and protecting foreign lands, we are finally going to build up our nation, defend our borders, and protect our lands and citizens. And we will stop illegal immigration once and for all. And we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally, all right? We do want people. We will not be invaded. We will not be occupied. We will not be overrun. We will not be conquered. They are conquering. They are conquering large sections of our country. We're being conquered. Can you believe that? The only difference is they're not wearing military uniforms. We will be a free and proud nation once again. Everyone will prosper, every family will thrive, and every day will be filled with opportunity and hope and the American Dream itself.

( 02:06:35 ) But for that to happen, we must defeat Kamala and stop her radical left agenda with a landslide that is too big to rig. Kamala destroyed perhaps the greatest city in our nation, San Francisco. It's an embarrassment what's happened to San Francisco. We're not going to let her destroy our country. So all I need is for you to get out and vote. For the past nine years, we have been fighting against the most sinister and corrupt forces on earth. We have to gather, all of us together. With your vote in this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them, this nation belongs to you, it belongs to you. Because it was the hardworking patriots like you who built this country and tomorrow it is the hardworking patriots like you who are going to save our country.

( 02:07:57 ) Think of this, I won't be doing this anymore with North Carolina, and I won't be doing this anymore after today. I'm just thinking as I'm going through this that this will be our final moment, but the more exciting moment is going to begin. See, these moments of hundreds and hundreds of the most incredible rallies at any country, no country's ever seen anything like that. But these moments that we've had together, these really were just to create what we hopefully will create tomorrow, which is we're going to make America great again. We had to get there.

( 02:08:38 ) So we'll have many meetings but we won't have rally meetings. Maybe we'll rally in that we'll rally in our success because we're going to make our country so successful. And we did it, we had the greatest economy, you see the numbers, you see the charts. We did such a good job, but we'll do a much better job now because I know the people. Now I know, I know the good ones, the bad ones. I know the weak ones, the strong ones. I know the stupid ones, I know the smart ones. I know them all.

( 02:09:14 ) After all we've been through together, we stand on the verge of the four greatest years in American history. With your help, we will restore America's promise and we will take back the nation that we all love so much. We are one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. We will never give in, we will never give up, we will never back down, and we will never, ever surrender. Together, we will fight, fight, fight and win, win win. November 5th will be the most important day in the history of our country. We're going to save our country, we're going to turn our country around and we're going to do it quickly and together we will make America powerful again. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America healthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, North Carolina, go out and vote.
